    "This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning.",
    "Many researchers have explored methods for hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) with temporal abstractions, in which abstract actions are defined that can perform many primitive actions before terminating. However, little is known about learning with state abstractions, in which aspects of the state space are ignored. In previous work, we developed the MAXQ method for hierarchical RL. In this paper, we define five conditions under which state abstraction can be combined with the MAXQ value function decomposition. We prove that the MAXQ-Q learning algorithm converges under these conditions and show experimentally that state abstraction is important for the successful application of MAXQ-Q learning.",
    "The multiplicative Newton-like method developed by the author et al. is extended to the situation where the dynamics is restricted to the orthogonal group. A general framework is constructed without specifying the cost function. Though the restriction to the orthogonal groups makes the problem somewhat complicated, an explicit expression for the amount of individual jumps is obtained. This algorithm is exactly second-order-convergent. The global instability inherent in the Newton method is remedied by a Levenberg-Marquardt-type variation. The method thus constructed can readily be applied to the independent component analysis. Its remarkable performance is illustrated by a numerical simulation.",
    "We construct new algorithms from scratch, which use the fourth order cumulant of stochastic variables for the cost function. The multiplicative updating rule here constructed is natural from the homogeneous nature of the Lie group and has numerous merits for the rigorous treatment of the dynamics. As one consequence, the second order convergence is shown. For the cost function, functions invariant under the componentwise scaling are choosen. By identifying points which can be transformed to each other by the scaling, we assume that the dynamics is in a coset space. In our method, a point can move toward any direction in this coset. Thus, no prewhitening is required.",
    "Given a reference computer, Kolmogorov complexity is a well defined function on all binary strings. In the standard approach, however, only the asymptotic properties of such functions are considered because they do not depend on the reference computer. We argue that this approach can be more useful if it is refined to include an important practical case of simple binary strings. Kolmogorov complexity calculus may be developed for this case if we restrict the class of available reference computers. The interesting problem is to define a class of computers which is restricted in a {\\it natural} way modeling the real-life situation where only a limited class of computers is physically available to us. We give an example of what such a natural restriction might look like mathematically, and show that under such restrictions some error terms, even logarithmic in complexity, can disappear from the standard complexity calculus.   Keywords: Kolmogorov complexity; Algorithmic information theory.",
    "In real-world environments it usually is difficult to specify target operating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs. This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management of classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems.",
    "An approach to clustering is presented that adapts the basic top-down induction of decision trees method towards clustering. To this aim, it employs the principles of instance based learning. The resulting methodology is implemented in the TIC (Top down Induction of Clustering trees) system for first order clustering. The TIC system employs the first order logical decision tree representation of the inductive logic programming system Tilde. Various experiments with TIC are presented, in both propositional and relational domains.",
    "When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency. Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently.   Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).   As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed scales up linearly in the number of examples.",
    "In order for an agent to perform well in partially observable domains, it is usually necessary for actions to depend on the history of observations. In this paper, we explore a {\\it stigmergic} approach, in which the agent's actions include the ability to set and clear bits in an external memory, and the external memory is included as part of the input to the agent. In this case, we need to learn a reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain. We explore two algorithms: SARSA(\\lambda), which has had empirical success in partially observable domains, and VAPS, a new algorithm due to Baird and Moore, with convergence guarantees in partially observable domains. We compare the performance of these two algorithms on benchmark problems.",
    "Cross-validation is a useful and generally applicable technique often employed in machine learning, including decision tree induction. An important disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield. The analysis is supported by experimental results.",
    "The Markov Blanket Bayesian Classifier is a recently-proposed algorithm for construction of probabilistic classifiers. This paper presents an empirical comparison of the MBBC algorithm with three other Bayesian classifiers: Naive Bayes, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes and a general Bayesian network. All of these are implemented using the K2 framework of Cooper and Herskovits. The classifiers are compared in terms of their performance (using simple accuracy measures and ROC curves) and speed, on a range of standard benchmark data sets. It is concluded that MBBC is competitive in terms of speed and accuracy with the other algorithms considered.",
    "In biological data, it is often the case that observed data are available only for a subset of samples. When a kernel matrix is derived from such data, we have to leave the entries for unavailable samples as missing. In this paper, we make use of a parametric model of kernel matrices, and estimate missing entries by fitting the model to existing entries. The parametric model is created as a set of spectral variants of a complete kernel matrix derived from another information source. For model fitting, we adopt the em algorithm based on the information geometry of positive definite matrices. We will report promising results on bacteria clustering experiments using two marker sequences: 16S and gyrB.",
    "To learn (statistical) dependencies among random variables requires exponentially large sample size in the number of observed random variables if any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur.   We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i.e., by a graph with small in-degree \\Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.   The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree \\Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for constant \\Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can be found by convex optimization.",
    "We make progress on two important problems regarding attribute efficient learnability.   First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length $k$ over $n$ variables using $2^{\\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})} \\log n$ examples and time $n^{\\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$. This is the first algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efficient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight.   Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$ out of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$. For $k=o(\\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity $o(n)$. This is the first polynomial time algorithm for learning parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity.",
    "Using naive Bayes for email classification has become very popular within the last few months. They are quite easy to implement and very efficient. In this paper we want to present empirical results of email classification using a combination of naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor searches. Using this technique we show that the accuracy of a Bayes filter can be improved slightly for a high number of features and significantly for a small number of features.",
    "It is offered to pool test points of different subjects and different aspects of the same subject together in order to get the unitary rating score, by the way of nonlinear transformation of indicator points in accordance with Zipf's distribution. It is proposed to use the well-studied distribution of Intellectuality Quotient IQ as the reference distribution for latent variable \"progress in studies\".",
    "For the last years, time-series mining has become a challenging issue for researchers. An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns. Any deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns. The proposed approach allows for mixed time-series -- containing both pattern and non-pattern data -- such as for imprecise matches, outliers, stretching and global translating of patterns instances in time. We present the early results of our approach in the context of monitoring the health status of a person at home. The purpose is to build a behavioral profile of a person by analyzing the time variations of several quantitative or qualitative parameters recorded through a provision of sensors installed in the home.",
    "We discuss stability for a class of learning algorithms with respect to noisy labels. The algorithms we consider are for regression, and they involve the minimization of regularized risk functionals, such as L(f) := 1/N sum_i (f(x_i)-y_i)^2+ lambda ||f||_H^2. We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when y_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the algorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously vanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N points remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N -> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is the expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we describe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give conditions for convergence. In the process, we develop a set of tools for dealing with functionals such as L(f), which are applicable to many other problems in learning theory.",
    "We consider the probability hierarchy for Popperian FINite learning and study the general properties of this hierarchy. We prove that the probability hierarchy is decidable, i.e. there exists an algorithm that receives p_1 and p_2 and answers whether PFIN-type learning with the probability of success p_1 is equivalent to PFIN-type learning with the probability of success p_2.   To prove our result, we analyze the topological structure of the probability hierarchy. We prove that it is well-ordered in descending ordering and order-equivalent to ordinal epsilon_0. This shows that the structure of the hierarchy is very complicated.   Using similar methods, we also prove that, for PFIN-type learning, team learning and probabilistic learning are of the same power.",
    "We analyze a new algorithm for probability forecasting of binary observations on the basis of the available data, without making any assumptions about the way the observations are generated. The algorithm is shown to be well calibrated and to have good resolution for long enough sequences of observations and for a suitable choice of its parameter, a kernel on the Cartesian product of the forecast space $[0,1]$ and the data space. Our main results are non-asymptotic: we establish explicit inequalities, shown to be tight, for the performance of the algorithm.",
    "We consider a general class of forecasting protocols, called \"linear protocols\", and discuss several important special cases, including multi-class forecasting. Forecasting is formalized as a game between three players: Reality, whose role is to generate observations; Forecaster, whose goal is to predict the observations; and Skeptic, who tries to make money on any lack of agreement between Forecaster's predictions and the actual observations. Our main mathematical result is that for any continuous strategy for Skeptic in a linear protocol there exists a strategy for Forecaster that does not allow Skeptic's capital to grow. This result is a meta-theorem that allows one to transform any continuous law of probability in a linear protocol into a forecasting strategy whose predictions are guaranteed to satisfy this law. We apply this meta-theorem to a weak law of large numbers in Hilbert spaces to obtain a version of the K29 prediction algorithm for linear protocols and show that this version also satisfies the attractive properties of proper calibration and resolution under a suitable choice of its kernel parameter, with no assumptions about the way the data is generated.",
    "This article offers a 3-parameter model of testing, with 1) the difference between the ability level of the examinee and item difficulty; 2) the examinee discrimination and 3) the item discrimination as model parameters.",
    "We propose a new framework for building and evaluating machine learning algorithms. We argue that many real-world problems require an agent which must quickly learn to respond to demands, yet can continue to perform and respond to new training throughout its useful life. We give a framework for how such agents can be built, describe several metrics for evaluating them, and show that subtle changes in system construction can significantly affect agent performance.",
    "We present in this work a new methodology to design kernels on data which is structured with smaller components, such as text, images or sequences. This methodology is a template procedure which can be applied on most kernels on measures and takes advantage of a more detailed \"bag of components\" representation of the objects. To obtain such a detailed description, we consider possible decompositions of the original bag into a collection of nested bags, following a prior knowledge on the objects' structure. We then consider these smaller bags to compare two objects both in a detailed perspective, stressing local matches between the smaller bags, and in a global or coarse perspective, by considering the entire bag. This multiresolution approach is likely to be best suited for tasks where the coarse approach is not precise enough, and where a more subtle mixture of both local and global similarities is necessary to compare objects. The approach presented here would not be computationally tractable without a factorization trick that we introduce before presenting promising results on an image retrieval task.",
    "This paper shows how universal learning can be achieved with expert advice. To this aim, we specify an experts algorithm with the following characteristics: (a) it uses only feedback from the actions actually chosen (bandit setup), (b) it can be applied with countably infinite expert classes, and (c) it copes with losses that may grow in time appropriately slowly. We prove loss bounds against an adaptive adversary. From this, we obtain a master algorithm for \"reactive\" experts problems, which means that the master's actions may influence the behavior of the adversary. Our algorithm can significantly outperform standard experts algorithms on such problems. Finally, we combine it with a universal expert class. The resulting universal learner performs -- in a certain sense -- almost as well as any computable strategy, for any online decision problem. We also specify the (worst-case) convergence speed, which is very slow.",
    "A main problem of \"Follow the Perturbed Leader\" strategies for online decision problems is that regret bounds are typically proven against oblivious adversary. In partial observation cases, it was not clear how to obtain performance guarantees against adaptive adversary, without worsening the bounds. We propose a conceptually simple argument to resolve this problem. Using this, a regret bound of O(t^(2/3)) for FPL in the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem is shown. This bound holds for the common FPL variant using only the observations from designated exploration rounds. Using all observations allows for the stronger bound of O(t^(1/2)), matching the best bound known so far (and essentially the known lower bound) for adversarial bandits. Surprisingly, this variant does not even need explicit exploration, it is self-stabilizing. However the sampling probabilities have to be either externally provided or approximated to sufficient accuracy, using O(t^2 log t) samples in each step.",
    "Naive Bayes is a simple Bayesian classifier with strong independence assumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong independence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that relaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve the classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an optimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring measure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time optimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have examined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a Naive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN structure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and present a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to MDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the augmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a relaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search methods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets. The authors, however, evaluate the learned structure only in terms of observed misclassification error and not against a scoring metric, such as MDL. In this paper, we present a simple, polynomial time greedy algorithm for learning an optimal Augmented Bayes Network with respect to MDL score.",
    "We consider the problem of learning unions of rectangles over the domain $[b]^n$, in the uniform distribution membership query learning setting, where both b and n are \"large\". We obtain poly$(n, \\log b)$-time algorithms for the following classes:   - poly$(n \\log b)$-way Majority of $O(\\frac{\\log(n \\log b)} {\\log \\log(n \\log b)})$-dimensional rectangles.   - Union of poly$(\\log(n \\log b))$ many $O(\\frac{\\log^2 (n \\log b)} {(\\log \\log(n \\log b) \\log \\log \\log (n \\log b))^2})$-dimensional rectangles.   - poly$(n \\log b)$-way Majority of poly$(n \\log b)$-Or of disjoint $O(\\frac{\\log(n \\log b)} {\\log \\log(n \\log b)})$-dimensional rectangles.   Our main algorithmic tool is an extension of Jackson's boosting- and Fourier-based Harmonic Sieve algorithm [Jackson 1997] to the domain $[b]^n$, building on work of [Akavia, Goldwasser, Safra 2003]. Other ingredients used to obtain the results stated above are techniques from exact learning [Beimel, Kushilevitz 1998] and ideas from recent work on learning augmented $AC^{0}$ circuits [Jackson, Klivans, Servedio 2002] and on representing Boolean functions as thresholds of parities [Klivans, Servedio 2001].",
    "We consider the problem of on-line prediction of real-valued labels, assumed bounded in absolute value by a known constant, of new objects from known labeled objects. The prediction algorithm's performance is measured by the squared deviation of the predictions from the actual labels. No stochastic assumptions are made about the way the labels and objects are generated. Instead, we are given a benchmark class of prediction rules some of which are hoped to produce good predictions. We show that for a wide range of infinite-dimensional benchmark classes one can construct a prediction algorithm whose cumulative loss over the first N examples does not exceed the cumulative loss of any prediction rule in the class plus O(sqrt(N)); the main differences from the known results are that we do not impose any upper bound on the norm of the considered prediction rules and that we achieve an optimal leading term in the excess loss of our algorithm. If the benchmark class is \"universal\" (dense in the class of continuous functions on each compact set), this provides an on-line non-stochastic analogue of universally consistent prediction in non-parametric statistics. We use two proof techniques: one is based on the Aggregating Algorithm and the other on the recently developed method of defensive forecasting.",
    "The problem of finding an optimum using noisy evaluations of a smooth cost function arises in many contexts, including economics, business, medicine, experiment design, and foraging theory. We derive an asymptotic bound E[ (x_t - x*)^2 ] >= O(1/sqrt(t)) on the rate of convergence of a sequence (x_0, x_1, >...) generated by an unbiased feedback process observing noisy evaluations of an unknown quadratic function maximised at x*. The bound is tight, as the proof leads to a simple algorithm which meets it. We further establish a bound on the total regret, E[ sum_{i=1..t} (x_i - x*)^2 ] >= O(sqrt(t)) These bounds may impose practical limitations on an agent's performance, as O(eps^-4) queries are made before the queries converge to x* with eps accuracy.",
    "A key data preparation step in Text Mining, Term Extraction selects the terms, or collocation of words, attached to specific concepts. In this paper, the task of extracting relevant collocations is achieved through a supervised learning algorithm, exploiting a few collocations manually labelled as relevant/irrelevant. The candidate terms are described along 13 standard statistical criteria measures. From these examples, an evolutionary learning algorithm termed Roger, based on the optimization of the Area under the ROC curve criterion, extracts an order on the candidate terms. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated on two real-world domain applications, considering different domains (biology and human resources) and different languages (English and French).",
    "We consider the problem of on-line prediction competitive with a benchmark class of continuous but highly irregular prediction rules. It is known that if the benchmark class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, there exists a prediction algorithm whose average loss over the first N examples does not exceed the average loss of any prediction rule in the class plus a \"regret term\" of O(N^(-1/2)). The elements of some natural benchmark classes, however, are so irregular that these classes are not Hilbert spaces. In this paper we develop Banach-space methods to construct a prediction algorithm with a regret term of O(N^(-1/p)), where p is in [2,infty) and p-2 reflects the degree to which the benchmark class fails to be a Hilbert space.",
    "Fitness functions based on test cases are very common in Genetic Programming (GP). This process can be assimilated to a learning task, with the inference of models from a limited number of samples. This paper is an investigation on two methods to improve generalization in GP-based learning: 1) the selection of the best-of-run individuals using a three data sets methodology, and 2) the application of parsimony pressure in order to reduce the complexity of the solutions. Results using GP in a binary classification setup show that while the accuracy on the test sets is preserved, with less variances compared to baseline results, the mean tree size obtained with the tested methods is significantly reduced.",
    "It is suggested to insert into test matrix 1s for correct responses, 0s for response refusals, and negative corrective elements for incorrect responses. With the classical test theory approach test scores of examinees and items are calculated traditionally as sums of matrix elements, organized in rows and columns. Correlation coefficients are estimated using correction coefficients. In item response theory approach examinee and item logits are estimated using maximum likelihood method and probabilities of all matrix elements.",
    "Given a finite set of words w1,...,wn independently drawn according to a fixed unknown distribution law P called a stochastic language, an usual goal in Grammatical Inference is to infer an estimate of P in some class of probabilistic models, such as Probabilistic Automata (PA). Here, we study the class of rational stochastic languages, which consists in stochastic languages that can be generated by Multiplicity Automata (MA) and which strictly includes the class of stochastic languages generated by PA. Rational stochastic languages have minimal normal representation which may be very concise, and whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from stochastic samples. We design an efficient inference algorithm DEES which aims at building a minimal normal representation of the target. Despite the fact that no recursively enumerable class of MA computes exactly the set of rational stochastic languages over Q, we show that DEES strongly identifies tis set in the limit. We study the intermediary MA output by DEES and show that they compute rational series which converge absolutely to one and which can be used to provide stochastic languages which closely estimate the target.",
    "Consider an agent interacting with an environment in cycles. In every interaction cycle the agent is rewarded for its performance. We compare the average reward U from cycle 1 to m (average value) with the future discounted reward V from cycle k to infinity (discounted value). We consider essentially arbitrary (non-geometric) discount sequences and arbitrary reward sequences (non-MDP environments). We show that asymptotically U for m->infinity and V for k->infinity are equal, provided both limits exist. Further, if the effective horizon grows linearly with k or faster, then existence of the limit of U implies that the limit of V exists. Conversely, if the effective horizon grows linearly with k or slower, then existence of the limit of V implies that the limit of U exists.",
    "Suppose we are given two probability measures on the set of one-way infinite finite-alphabet sequences and consider the question when one of the measures predicts the other, that is, when conditional probabilities converge (in a certain sense) when one of the measures is chosen to generate the sequence. This question may be considered a refinement of the problem of sequence prediction in its most general formulation: for a given class of probability measures, does there exist a measure which predicts all of the measures in the class? To address this problem, we find some conditions on local absolute continuity which are sufficient for prediction and which generalize several different notions which are known to be sufficient for prediction. We also formulate some open questions to outline a direction for finding the conditions on classes of measures for which prediction is possible.",
    "Prediction is a complex notion, and different predictors (such as people, computer programs, and probabilistic theories) can pursue very different goals. In this paper I will review some popular kinds of prediction and argue that the theory of competitive on-line learning can benefit from the kinds of prediction that are now foreign to it.",
    "A standard approach in pattern classification is to estimate the distributions of the label classes, and then to apply the Bayes classifier to the estimates of the distributions in order to classify unlabeled examples. As one might expect, the better our estimates of the label class distributions, the better the resulting classifier will be. In this paper we make this observation precise by identifying risk bounds of a classifier in terms of the quality of the estimates of the label class distributions. We show how PAC learnability relates to estimates of the distributions that have a PAC guarantee on their $L_1$ distance from the true distribution, and we bound the increase in negative log likelihood risk in terms of PAC bounds on the KL-divergence. We give an inefficient but general-purpose smoothing method for converting an estimated distribution that is good under the $L_1$ metric into a distribution that is good under the KL-divergence.",
    "In this paper we introduce the class of stationary prediction strategies and construct a prediction algorithm that asymptotically performs as well as the best continuous stationary strategy. We make mild compactness assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about the environment. In particular, no assumption of stationarity is made about the environment, and the stationarity of the considered strategies only means that they do not depend explicitly on time; we argue that it is natural to consider only stationary strategies even for highly non-stationary environments.",
    "In probabilistic grammatical inference, a usual goal is to infer a good approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable, it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms them in most cases.",
    "We investigate here concept learning from incomplete examples. Our first purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be modified in order to cope with data incompleteness. More precisely we are interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by L. De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First, uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second, generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as \"learning from possibilities\" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific learning setting, referred to as \"assumption-based learning\" that cope with examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual information outside of the proper description of the examples. Assumption-based learning is illustrated on a recent work concerning the prediction of a consensus secondary structure common to a set of RNA sequences.",
    "We present a theory of boosting probabilistic classifiers. We place ourselves in the situation of a user who only provides a stopping parameter and a probabilistic weak learner/classifier and compare three types of boosting algorithms: probabilistic Adaboost, decision tree, and tree of trees of ... of trees, which we call matryoshka. \"Nested tree,\" \"embedded tree\" and \"recursive tree\" are also appropriate names for this algorithm, which is one of our contributions. Our other contribution is the theoretical analysis of the algorithms, in which we give training error bounds. This analysis suggests that the matryoshka leverages probabilistic weak classifiers more efficiently than simple decision trees.",
    "We start from a simple asymptotic result for the problem of on-line regression with the quadratic loss function: the class of continuous limited-memory prediction strategies admits a \"leading prediction strategy\", which not only asymptotically performs at least as well as any continuous limited-memory strategy but also satisfies the property that the excess loss of any continuous limited-memory strategy is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy. More specifically, for any class of prediction strategies constituting a reproducing kernel Hilbert space we construct a leading strategy, in the sense that the loss of any prediction strategy whose norm is not too large is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy. This result is extended to the loss functions given by Bregman divergences and by strictly proper scoring rules.",
    "Assuming that the loss function is convex in the prediction, we construct a prediction strategy universal for the class of Markov prediction strategies, not necessarily continuous. Allowing randomization, we remove the requirement of convexity.",
    "We present basic notions of Gold's \"learnability in the limit\" paradigm, first presented in 1967, a formalization of the cognitive process by which a native speaker gets to grasp the underlying grammar of his/her own native language by being exposed to well formed sentences generated by that grammar. Then we present Lambek grammars, a formalism issued from categorial grammars which, although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural languages, is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface between syntax and semantics. In the last part of this work, we present a learnability result for Rigid Lambek grammars from structured examples.",
    "An approach to the classification problem of machine learning, based on building local classification rules, is developed. The local rules are considered as projections of the global classification rules to the event we want to classify. A massive global optimization algorithm is used for optimization of quality criterion. The algorithm, which has polynomial complexity in typical case, is used to find all high--quality local rules. The other distinctive feature of the algorithm is the integration of attributes levels selection (for ordered attributes) with rules searching and original conflicting rules resolution strategy. The algorithm is practical; it was tested on a number of data sets from UCI repository, and a comparison with the other predicting techniques is presented.",
    "Competitive on-line prediction (also known as universal prediction of individual sequences) is a strand of learning theory avoiding making any stochastic assumptions about the way the observations are generated. The predictor's goal is to compete with a benchmark class of prediction rules, which is often a proper Banach function space. Metric entropy provides a unifying framework for competitive on-line prediction: the numerous known upper bounds on the metric entropy of various compact sets in function spaces readily imply bounds on the performance of on-line prediction strategies. This paper discusses strengths and limitations of the direct approach to competitive on-line prediction via metric entropy, including comparisons to other approaches.",
    "We propose and analyze a new vantage point for the learning of mixtures of Gaussians: namely, the PAC-style model of learning probability distributions introduced by Kearns et al. Here the task is to construct a hypothesis mixture of Gaussians that is statistically indistinguishable from the actual mixture generating the data; specifically, the KL-divergence should be at most epsilon.   In this scenario, we give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm that learns the class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned Gaussians in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the separation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence on the minimum mixing weight. This is in contrast to learning results known in the ``clustering'' model, where such assumptions are unavoidable.   Our algorithm relies on the method of moments, and a subalgorithm developed in previous work by the authors (FOCS 2005) for a discrete mixture-learning problem.",
    "Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to design efficient prediction algorithms for data sets with huge numbers of parameters. This paper describes a new technique for \"hedging\" the predictions output by many such algorithms, including support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, kernel nearest neighbours, and by many other state-of-the-art methods. The hedged predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate predictions as possible. This can be done successfully using the powerful machinery of modern machine learning.",
    "This paper addresses the issue of policy evaluation in Markov Decision Processes, using linear function approximation. It provides a unified view of algorithms such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), iLSTD, residual-gradient TD. It is asserted that they all consist in minimizing a gradient function and differ by the form of this function and their means of minimizing it. Two new schemes are introduced in that framework: Full-gradient TD which uses a generalization of the principle introduced in iLSTD, and EGD TD, which reduces the gradient by successive equi-gradient descents. These three algorithms form a new intermediate family with the interesting property of making much better use of the samples than TD while keeping a gradient descent scheme, which is useful for complexity issues and optimistic policy iteration.",
    "Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too ``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D \\sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz function, given noisy data.",
    "We propose an axiomatic approach to the concept of an intrinsic dimension of a dataset, based on a viewpoint of geometry of high-dimensional structures. Our first axiom postulates that high values of dimension be indicative of the presence of the curse of dimensionality (in a certain precise mathematical sense). The second axiom requires the dimension to depend smoothly on a distance between datasets (so that the dimension of a dataset and that of an approximating principal manifold would be close to each other). The third axiom is a normalization condition: the dimension of the Euclidean $n$-sphere $\\s^n$ is $\\Theta(n)$. We give an example of a dimension function satisfying our axioms, even though it is in general computationally unfeasible, and discuss a computationally cheap function satisfying most but not all of our axioms (the ``intrinsic dimensionality'' of Ch\\'avez et al.)",
    "This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning (PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.",
    "We introduce a framework for filtering features that employs the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependence between the features and the labels. The key idea is that good features should maximise such dependence. Feature selection for various supervised learning problems (including classification and regression) is unified under this framework, and the solutions can be approximated using a backward-elimination algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on both artificial and real world datasets.",
    "Speaker identification is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, we present a sub-band based speaker identification that intends to improve the live testing performance. Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved the performance of the speaker identification over the performance of wide-band recognizers when tested live. A live testing improvement of 9.78% was achieved",
    "Bounds on the risk play a crucial role in statistical learning theory. They usually involve as capacity measure of the model studied the VC dimension or one of its extensions. In classification, such \"VC dimensions\" exist for models taking values in {0, 1}, {1,..., Q} and R. We introduce the generalizations appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in R^Q. This provides us with a new guaranteed risk for M-SVMs which appears superior to the existing one.",
    "We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.",
    "Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output or label space $\\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\\CX$, given a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\\CX \\times \\CY$. However, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to deal with this problem is {\\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related field of active learning.",
    "The method of defensive forecasting is applied to the problem of prediction with expert advice for binary outcomes. It turns out that defensive forecasting is not only competitive with the Aggregating Algorithm but also handles the case of \"second-guessing\" experts, whose advice depends on the learner's prediction; this paper assumes that the dependence on the learner's prediction is continuous.",
    "Defensive forecasting is a method of transforming laws of probability (stated in game-theoretic terms as strategies for Sceptic) into forecasting algorithms. There are two known varieties of defensive forecasting: \"continuous\", in which Sceptic's moves are assumed to depend on the forecasts in a (semi)continuous manner and which produces deterministic forecasts, and \"randomized\", in which the dependence of Sceptic's moves on the forecasts is arbitrary and Forecaster's moves are allowed to be randomized. This note shows that the randomized variety can be obtained from the continuous variety by smearing Sceptic's moves to make them continuous.",
    "The purpose of this note is to show how the method of maximum entropy in the mean (MEM) may be used to improve parametric estimation when the measurements are corrupted by large level of noise. The method is developed in the context on a concrete example: that of estimation of the parameter in an exponential distribution. We compare the performance of our method with the bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches.",
    "We show that the Brier game of prediction is mixable and find the optimal learning rate and substitution function for it. The resulting prediction algorithm is applied to predict results of football and tennis matches. The theoretical performance guarantee turns out to be rather tight on these data sets, especially in the case of the more extensive tennis data.",
    "Regularization by the sum of singular values, also referred to as the trace norm, is a popular technique for estimating low rank rectangular matrices. In this paper, we extend some of the consistency results of the Lasso to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency of trace norm minimization with the square loss. We also provide an adaptive version that is rank consistent even when the necessary condition for the non adaptive version is not fulfilled.",
    "Recent spectral clustering methods are a propular and powerful technique for data clustering. These methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples. In this paper, a non-eigenproblem based clustering method is proposed to deal with the clustering problem. Its performance is comparable to the spectral clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity $O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property, called K-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise. Moreover, no parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm.",
    "Covariances from categorical variables are defined using a regular simplex expression for categories. The method follows the variance definition by Gini, and it gives the covariance as a solution of simultaneous equations. The calculated results give reasonable values for test data. A method of principal component analysis (RS-PCA) is also proposed using regular simplex expressions, which allows easy interpretation of the principal components. The proposed methods apply to variable selection problem of categorical data USCensus1990 data. The proposed methods give appropriate criterion for the variable selection problem of categorical",
    "For a classification problem described by the joint density $P(\\omega,x)$, models of $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have been shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor classification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\\omega|x)$ given $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper identifies a distinct class of classification problems using $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ to solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution.",
    "Learning machines which have hierarchical structures or hidden variables are singular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and their Fisher information matrices are singular. In singular statistical models, neither the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error, and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any parametric model, and any a priori distribution. Also we show that Bayes and Gibbs generalization errors are estimated by Bayes and Gibbs training errors, and propose widely applicable information criteria which can be applied to both regular and singular statistical models.",
    "We consider the problem of choosing a density estimate from a set of distributions F, minimizing the L1-distance to an unknown distribution (Devroye, Lugosi 2001). Devroye and Lugosi analyze two algorithms for the problem: Scheffe tournament winner and minimum distance estimate. The Scheffe tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.   We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second one, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear number of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.   We also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be improved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation.",
    "Point clouds are sets of points in two or three dimensions. Most kernel methods for learning on sets of points have not yet dealt with the specific geometrical invariances and practical constraints associated with point clouds in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we present extensions of graph kernels for point clouds, which allow to use kernel methods for such ob jects as shapes, line drawings, or any three-dimensional point clouds. In order to design rich and numerically efficient kernels with as few free parameters as possible, we use kernels between covariance matrices and their factorizations on graphical models. We derive polynomial time dynamic programming recursions and present applications to recognition of handwritten digits and Chinese characters from few training examples.",
    "The cross-entropy method is a simple but efficient method for global optimization. In this paper we provide two online variants of the basic CEM, together with a proof of convergence.",
    "We prove that the optimal assignment kernel, proposed recently as an attempt to embed labeled graphs and more generally tuples of basic data to a Hilbert space, is in fact not always positive definite.",
    "Given R groups of numerical variables X1, ... XR, we assume that each group is the result of one underlying latent variable, and that all latent variables are bound together through a linear equation system. Moreover, we assume that some explanatory latent variables may interact pairwise in one or more equations. We basically consider PLS Path Modelling's algorithm to estimate both latent variables and the model's coefficients. New \"external\" estimation schemes are proposed that draw latent variables towards strong group structures in a more flexible way. New \"internal\" estimation schemes are proposed to enable PLSPM to make good use of variable group complementarity and to deal with interactions. Application examples are given.",
    "We present a general approach for collaborative filtering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators from \"users\" to the \"objects\" they rate. Recent low-rank type matrix completion approaches to CF are shown to be special cases. However, unlike existing regularization based CF methods, our approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the users or the objects -- a limitation of existing regularization based CF methods. We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.",
    "We study the problem of learning k-juntas given access to examples drawn from a number of different product distributions. Thus we wish to learn a function f : {-1,1}^n -> {-1,1} that depends on k (unknown) coordinates. While the best known algorithms for the general problem of learning a k-junta require running time of n^k * poly(n,2^k), we show that given access to k different product distributions with biases separated by \\gamma>0, the functions may be learned in time poly(n,2^k,\\gamma^{-k}). More generally, given access to t <= k different product distributions, the functions may be learned in time n^{k/t} * poly(n,2^k,\\gamma^{-k}). Our techniques involve novel results in Fourier analysis relating Fourier expansions with respect to different biases and a generalization of Russo's formula.",
    "The use of computational intelligence techniques for classification has been used in numerous applications. This paper compares the use of a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network and a new Relational Network on classifying the HIV status of women at ante-natal clinics. The paper discusses the architecture of the relational network and its merits compared to a neural network and most other computational intelligence classifiers. Results gathered from the study indicate comparable classification accuracies as well as revealed relationships between data features in the classification data. Much higher classification accuracies are recommended for future research in the area of HIV classification as well as missing data estimation.",
    "This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9 classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024 as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function.",
    "Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters: the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the 2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2, as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established.",
    "This article considers constrained $\\ell_1$ minimization methods for the recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless, bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given in these noise settings for two $\\ell_1$ minimization methods: the Dantzig selector and $\\ell_1$ minimization with an $\\ell_2$ constraint. The results of this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the conditions and tightening the error bounds. The improvement on the conditions shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately. This paper also establishes connections between restricted isometry property and the mutual incoherence property. Some results of Candes, Romberg and Tao (2006) and Donoho, Elad, and Temlyakov (2006) are extended.",
    "We identify the classical Perceptron algorithm with margin as a member of a broader family of large margin classifiers which we collectively call the Margitron. The Margitron, (despite its) sharing the same update rule with the Perceptron, is shown in an incremental setting to converge in a finite number of updates to solutions possessing any desirable fraction of the maximum margin. Experiments comparing the Margitron with decomposition SVMs on tasks involving linear kernels and 2-norm soft margin are also reported.",
    "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sample selection bias correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally stable algorithm.",
    "This article describes an approach to designing a distributed and modular neural classifier. This approach introduces a new hierarchical clustering that enables one to determine reliable regions in the representation space by exploiting supervised information. A multilayer perceptron is then associated with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular classifiers are given.",

    "Statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes, particularly those with finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy. Here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions. Since the VC-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned. We first show that learning in this setting is indeed possible, and develop a learning algorithm. We then show, however, that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible. Notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable, and not due to the statistical nature of the problem.",
    "We prove that the class of functions g:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1} that only depend on an unknown subset of k<<n variables (so-called k-juntas) is agnostically learnable from a random walk in time polynomial in n, 2^{k^2}, epsilon^{-k}, and log(1/delta). In other words, there is an algorithm with the claimed running time that, given epsilon, delta > 0 and access to a random walk on {-1,+1}^n labeled by an arbitrary function f:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1}, finds with probability at least 1-delta a k-junta that is (opt(f)+epsilon)-close to f, where opt(f) denotes the distance of a closest k-junta to f.",
    "The method of stable random projections is a tool for efficiently computing the $l_\\alpha$ distances using low memory, where $0<\\alpha \\leq 2$ is a tuning parameter. The method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various estimators have been proposed, based on the geometric mean, the harmonic mean, and the fractional power etc.   This study proposes the optimal quantile estimator, whose main operation is selecting, which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power, the main operation in previous estimators. Our experiments report that the optimal quantile estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators. For large-scale learning tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable.   In addition to its computational advantages, the optimal quantile estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties. It is more accurate than previous estimators when $\\alpha>1$. We derive its theoretical error bounds and establish the explicit (i.e., no hidden constants) sample complexity bound.",
    "Applications in machine learning and data mining require computing pairwise Lp distances in a data matrix A. For massive high-dimensional data, computing all pairwise distances of A can be infeasible. In fact, even storing A or all pairwise distances of A in the memory may be also infeasible. This paper proposes a simple method for p = 2, 4, 6, ... We first decompose the l_p (where p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products'' at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are non-negative, which is common in reality.",
    "We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk graph kernel \\citep{GaeFlaWro03,BorOngSchVisetal05}, marginalized graph kernel \\citep{KasTsuIno03,KasTsuIno04,MahUedAkuPeretal04}, and geometric kernel on graphs \\citep{Gaertner02}. Through extensions of linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and reduction to a Sylvester equation, we construct an algorithm that improves the time complexity of kernel computation from $O(n^6)$ to $O(n^3)$. When the graphs are sparse, conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations bring our algorithm into the sub-cubic domain. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster than previous approaches. We then explore connections between diffusion kernels \\citep{KonLaf02}, regularization on graphs \\citep{SmoKon03}, and graph kernels, and use these connections to propose new graph kernels. Finally, we show that rational kernels \\citep{CorHafMoh02,CorHafMoh03,CorHafMoh04} when specialized to graphs reduce to the random walk graph kernel.",
    "We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees. First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked trees.",
    "We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive combination of individually representable observations is also representable by the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also propose a network for language modeling.",
    "We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the {\\em representer theorem}, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing function.",
    "In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may benefit from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non convex methods dedicated to the same problem.",
    "We consider the task of learning a classifier from the feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ to the set of classes $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1\\}$, when the features can be partitioned into class-conditionally independent feature sets $\\mathcal{X}_1$ and $\\mathcal{X}_2$. We show the surprising fact that the class-conditional independence can be used to represent the original learning task in terms of 1) learning a classifier from $\\mathcal{X}_2$ to $\\mathcal{X}_1$ and 2) learning the class-conditional distribution of the feature set $\\mathcal{X}_1$. This fact can be exploited for semi-supervised learning because the former task can be accomplished purely from unlabeled samples. We present experimental evaluation of the idea in two real world applications.",
    "Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) and its variants have been very successful in embedding data-manifolds in lower dimensional spaces, often revealing the true intrinsic dimension. In this paper we show how to also incorporate supervised class information into an MVU-like method without breaking its convexity. We call this method the Isometric Separation Map and we show that the resulting kernel matrix can be used as a binary/multiclass Support Vector Machine-like method in a semi-supervised (transductive) framework. We also show that the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the training data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces. In traditional SVMs we choose a kernel and hope that the data become linearly separable in the kernel space. In this paper we show how the hyperplane can be chosen ad-hoc and the kernel is trained so that data are always linearly separable. Comparisons with Large Margin SVMs show comparable performance.",
    "In this paper, I expand Shannon's definition of entropy into a new form of entropy that allows integration of information from different random events. Shannon's notion of entropy is a special case of my more general definition of entropy. I define probability using a so-called performance function, which is de facto an exponential distribution. Assuming that my general notion of entropy reflects the true uncertainty about a probabilistic event, I understand that our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the result of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese philosophy: Yin and Yang. Based on this idea, I show that our perceived uncertainty matches the true uncertainty in points determined by the golden ratio. I demonstrate that the well-known sigmoid function, which we typically employ in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function, describes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the time dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that although time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to reality. At the end of the paper, I show how to apply this theoretical framework to practical applications. I present recognition rates for a pattern recognition problem, and also propose a network architecture that can take advantage of general entropy to solve complex decision problems.",
    "Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.   This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.   We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.",
    "Ensemble classification is an emerging approach to land cover mapping whereby the final classification output is a result of a consensus of classifiers. Intuitively, an ensemble system should consist of base classifiers which are diverse i.e. classifiers whose decision boundaries err differently. In this paper ensemble feature selection is used to impose diversity in ensembles. The features of the constituent base classifiers for each ensemble were created through an exhaustive search algorithm using different separability indices. For each ensemble, the classification accuracy was derived as well as a diversity measure purported to give a measure of the inensemble diversity. The correlation between ensemble classification accuracy and diversity measure was determined to establish the interplay between the two variables. From the findings of this paper, diversity measures as currently formulated do not provide an adequate means upon which to constitute ensembles for land cover mapping.",
    "The enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum random walk (QRW) with the problem of data clustering, and develop two clustering algorithms based on the one dimensional QRW. Then, the probability distributions on the positions induced by QRW in these algorithms are investigated, which also indicates the possibility of obtaining better results. Consequently, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the clustering algorithms are of fast rates of convergence. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
    "We present a convex formulation of dictionary learning for sparse signal decomposition. Convexity is obtained by replacing the usual explicit upper bound on the dictionary size by a convex rank-reducing term similar to the trace norm. In particular, our formulation introduces an explicit trade-off between size and sparsity of the decomposition of rectangular matrices. Using a large set of synthetic examples, we compare the estimation abilities of the convex and non-convex approaches, showing that while the convex formulation has a single local minimum, this may lead in some cases to performance which is inferior to the local minima of the non-convex formulation.",
    "We introduce a simple and computationally trivial method for binary classification based on the evaluation of potential functions. We demonstrate that despite the conceptual and computational simplicity of the method its performance can match or exceed that of standard Support Vector Machine methods.",
    "We consider bandit problems involving a large (possibly infinite) collection of arms, in which the expected reward of each arm is a linear function of an $r$-dimensional random vector $\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^r$, where $r \\geq 2$. The objective is to minimize the cumulative regret and Bayes risk. When the set of arms corresponds to the unit sphere, we prove that the regret and Bayes risk is of order $\\Theta(r \\sqrt{T})$, by establishing a lower bound for an arbitrary policy, and showing that a matching upper bound is obtained through a policy that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases. The phase-based policy is also shown to be effective if the set of arms satisfies a strong convexity condition. For the case of a general set of arms, we describe a near-optimal policy whose regret and Bayes risk admit upper bounds of the form $O(r \\sqrt{T} \\log^{3/2} T)$.",
    "We present a practical and statistically consistent scheme for actively learning binary classifiers under general loss functions. Our algorithm uses importance weighting to correct sampling bias, and by controlling the variance, we are able to give rigorous label complexity bounds for the learning process. Experiments on passively labeled data show that this approach reduces the label complexity required to achieve good predictive performance on many learning problems.",
    "Cooperative decision making is a vision of future network management and control. Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network. Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes. Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop, based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and simulation.",
    "In statistical problems, a set of parameterized probability distributions is used to estimate the true probability distribution. If Fisher information matrix at the true distribution is singular, then it has been left unknown what we can estimate about the true distribution from random samples. In this paper, we study a singular regression problem and prove a limit theorem which shows the relation between the singular regression problem and two birational invariants, a real log canonical threshold and a singular fluctuation. The obtained theorem has an important application to statistics, because it enables us to estimate the generalization error from the training error without any knowledge of the true probability distribution.",
    "Scenarios for the emergence or bootstrap of a lexicon involve the repeated interaction between at least two agents who must reach a consensus on how to name N objects using H words. Here we consider minimal models of two types of learning algorithms: cross-situational learning, in which the individuals determine the meaning of a word by looking for something in common across all observed uses of that word, and supervised operant conditioning learning, in which there is strong feedback between individuals about the intended meaning of the words. Despite the stark differences between these learning schemes, we show that they yield the same communication accuracy in the realistic limits of large N and H, which coincides with the result of the classical occupancy problem of randomly assigning N objects to H words.",
    "In this paper, we propose a technique to extract constrained formal concepts.",
    "Recently, different works proposed a new way to mine patterns in databases with pathological size. For example, experiments in genome biology usually provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects (experiments). In this case, mining the \"transposed\" database runs through a smaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed patterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and constraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition and look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating the closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint, starting from those mined in the \"transposed\" database. Finally, we show how to generate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones.",
    "We consider multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the assumption of output sparsity -- that the target (label) vectors have small support. We develop a general theory for a variant of the popular error correcting output code scheme, using ideas from compressed sensing for exploiting this sparsity. The method can be regarded as a simple reduction from multi-label regression problems to binary regression problems. We show that the number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible labels, making this approach radically more efficient than others. We also state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting.",
    "This paper formalises the concept of learning symbolic rules from multisource data in a cardiac monitoring context. Our sources, electrocardiograms and arterial blood pressure measures, describe cardiac behaviours from different viewpoints. To learn interpretable rules, we use an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) method. We develop an original strategy to cope with the dimensionality issues caused by using this ILP technique on a rich multisource language. The results show that our method greatly improves the feasibility and the efficiency of the process while staying accurate. They also confirm the benefits of using multiple sources to improve the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "The problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries is often encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an underlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer vision and control. Most recent work had been focused on constructing efficient algorithms for exact or approximate recovery of the missing matrix entries and proving lower bounds for the number of known entries that guarantee a successful recovery with high probability. A related problem from both the mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise distances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that basic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness of low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that distances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient randomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion. Crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix, that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix.",
    "We introduce a new protocol for prediction with expert advice in which each expert evaluates the learner's and his own performance using a loss function that may change over time and may be different from the loss functions used by the other experts. The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously. If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the case of \"specialist\" (or \"sleeping\") experts. In this case, the defensive forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating Algorithm.",
    "We present multiplicative updates for solving hard and soft margin support vector machines (SVM) with non-negative kernels. They follow as a natural extension of the updates for non-negative matrix factorization. No additional param- eter setting, such as choosing learning, rate is required. Ex- periments demonstrate rapid convergence to good classifiers. We analyze the rates of asymptotic convergence of the up- dates and establish tight bounds. We test the performance on several datasets using various non-negative kernels and report equivalent generalization errors to that of a standard SVM.",
    "Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers. When the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme case, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination, and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by distributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0).",

    "A $p$-adic modification of the split-LBG classification method is presented in which first clusterings and then cluster centers are computed which locally minimise an energy function. The outcome for a fixed dataset is independent of the prime number $p$ with finitely many exceptions. The methods are applied to the construction of $p$-adic classifiers in the context of learning.",
    "This paper uses the notion of algorithmic stability to derive novel generalization bounds for several families of transductive regression algorithms, both by using convexity and closed-form solutions. Our analysis helps compare the stability of these algorithms. It also shows that a number of widely used transductive regression algorithms are in fact unstable. Finally, it reports the results of experiments with local transductive regression demonstrating the benefit of our stability bounds for model selection, for one of the algorithms, in particular for determining the radius of the local neighborhood used by the algorithm.",
    "Motivation: Several different threads of research have been proposed for modeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model relationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are intractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as frequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the rigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical models literature.   Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of research, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be inferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the modeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter. First, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on influences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using a greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN structure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct occurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, we focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called excitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can be conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on datasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real neuroscience datasets are presented.   Availability: Algorithmic implementations, simulator codebases, and datasets are available from our website at http://neural-code.cs.vt.edu/dbn",

    "In this paper, we consider the coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty of Walley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability distributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a categorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state of prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem, another state of beliefs, called \\emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed. Near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows learning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of interest that is \\emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent variables (and general \\emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical problems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical problems.",
    "Engine assembly is a complex and heavily automated distributed-control process, with large amounts of faults data logged everyday. We describe an application of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine assembly plant. Frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method that can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs in an efficient manner. In addition to being theoretically elegant and computationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the form actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information is critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in the manufacturing domain. We show how domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated using heuristic rules that act as pre-filters and post-filters to frequent episode discovery. The system described here is currently being used in one of the engine assembly plants of General Motors and is planned for adaptation in other plants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the manufacturing domain. We believe that the ideas presented in this paper can help practitioners engineer tools for analysis in other similar or related application domains as well.",
    "This paper presents a new hybrid learning algorithm for unsupervised classification tasks. We combined Fuzzy c-means learning algorithm and a supervised version of Minimerror to develop a hybrid incremental strategy allowing unsupervised classifications. We applied this new approach to a real-world database in order to know if the information contained in unlabeled features of a Geographic Information System (GIS), allows to well classify it. Finally, we compared our results to a classical supervised classification obtained by a multilayer perceptron.",
    "We analyze the expected cost of a greedy active learning algorithm. Our analysis extends previous work to a more general setting in which different queries have different costs. Moreover, queries may have more than two possible responses and the distribution over hypotheses may be non uniform. Specific applications include active learning with label costs, active learning for multiclass and partial label queries, and batch mode active learning. We also discuss an approximate version of interest when there are very many queries.",
    "We present three related ways of using Transfer Learning to improve feature selection. The three methods address different problems, and hence share different kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three are based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first method, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for multiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features. MIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models and is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our second method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case when the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method, Transfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task to which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have different amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial when we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of labeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different verbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental results on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
    "Many learning machines that have hierarchical structure or hidden variables are now being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics. However, several learning machines used in such fields are not regular but singular statistical models, hence their generalization performance is still left unknown. To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we proved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the Bayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity contained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same equations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric model. Also we prove that, the proposed equations in a regular case are asymptotically equivalent to the Takeuchi information criterion. Therefore, the proposed equations are always applicable without any condition on the unknown true distribution.",
    "The problem of classifying sonar signals from rocks and mines first studied by Gorman and Sejnowski has become a benchmark against which many learning algorithms have been tested. We show that both the training set and the test set of this benchmark are linearly separable, although with different hyperplanes. Moreover, the complete set of learning and test patterns together, is also linearly separable. We give the weights that separate these sets, which may be used to compare results found by other algorithms.",
    "Clusters of genes that have evolved by repeated segmental duplication present difficult challenges throughout genomic analysis, from sequence assembly to functional analysis. Improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including HIV and a variety of cancers. Previously, Zhang et al. (2008) developed an algorithm for reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using only human genomic sequence data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for the evolution of gene clusters on a phylogeny, and an MCMC algorithm for reconstruction of duplication histories from genomic sequences in multiple species. Several projects are underway to obtain high quality BAC-based assemblies of duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that our method will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets.",
    "In this paper, we present two classes of Bayesian approaches to the two-sample problem. Our first class of methods extends the Bayesian t-test to include all parametric models in the exponential family and their conjugate priors.

    "In this paper, we present the step by step knowledge acquisition process by choosing a structured method through using a questionnaire as a knowledge acquisition tool. Here we want to depict the problem domain as, how to evaluate teachers performance in higher education through the use of expert system technology. The problem is how to acquire the specific knowledge for a selected problem efficiently and effectively from human experts and encode it in the suitable computer format. Acquiring knowledge from human experts in the process of expert systems development is one of the most common problems cited till yet. This questionnaire was sent to 87 domain experts within all public and private universities in Pakistani. Among them 25 domain experts sent their valuable opinions. Most of the domain experts were highly qualified, well experienced and highly responsible persons. The whole questionnaire was divided into 15 main groups of factors, which were further divided into 99 individual questions. These facts were analyzed further to give a final shape to the questionnaire. This knowledge acquisition technique may be used as a learning tool for further research work.",
    "We describe an adaptation and application of a search-based structured prediction algorithm \"Searn\" to unsupervised learning problems. We show that it is possible to reduce unsupervised learning to supervised learning and demonstrate a high-quality unsupervised shift-reduce parsing model. We additionally show a close connection between unsupervised Searn and expectation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a semi-supervised extension. The key idea that enables this is an application of the predict-self idea for unsupervised learning.",

    "We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these \"reference types\") that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple--but general--parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.",
    "Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework for density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost: inference in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when conjugate distributions are used. In the common case when one seeks only a maximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search algorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive MCMC and variational techniques. When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large data sets.",
    "The maze traversal problem (finding the shortest distance to the goal from any position in a maze) has been an interesting challenge in computational intelligence. Recent work has shown that the cellular simultaneous recurrent neural network (CSRN) can solve this problem for simple mazes. This thesis focuses on exploiting relevant information about the maze to improve learning and decrease the training time for the CSRN to solve mazes. Appropriate variables are identified to create useful clusters using relevant information. The CSRN was next modified to allow for an additional external input. With this additional input, several methods were tested and results show that clustering the mazes improves the overall learning of the traversal problem for the CSRN.",
    "We propose a randomized algorithm for training Support vector machines(SVMs) on large datasets. By using ideas from Random projections we show that the combinatorial dimension of SVMs is $O({log} n)$ with high probability. This estimate of combinatorial dimension is used to derive an iterative algorithm, called RandSVM, which at each step calls an existing solver to train SVMs on a randomly chosen subset of size $O({log} n)$. The algorithm has probabilistic guarantees and is capable of training SVMs with Kernels for both classification and regression problems. Experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets demonstrate that the algorithm scales up existing SVM learners, without loss of accuracy.",
    "We investigate the problem of learning a topic model - the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation - in a distributed manner, using a cluster of C processors and dividing the corpus to be learned equally among them.

Our approach is asynchronous, and therefore suitable for clusters of heterogenous machines.",
    "In Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. In this paper we propose a new approach to prune and filter discovered rules. Using Domain Ontologies, we strengthen the integration of user knowledge in the post-processing task. Furthermore, an interactive and iterative framework is designed to assist the user along the analyzing task. On the one hand, we represent user domain knowledge using a Domain Ontology over database. On the other hand, a novel technique is suggested to prune and to filter discovered rules. The proposed framework was applied successfully over the client database provided by Nantes Habitat.",
    "Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately, exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the variable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We describe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by deriving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP approximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a compact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we show how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy. In particular, we show that endowing each basis point with its own full covariance matrix provides a significant increase in approximation power.",

    "We propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data based on score functions derived from nearest neighbor graphs on $n$-point nominal data. Anomalies are declared whenever the score of a test sample falls below $\\alpha$, which is supposed to be the desired false alarm level. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that it is uniformly most powerful for the specified false alarm level, $\\alpha$, for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the nominal and a known density. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, being linear in dimension and quadratic in data size. It does not require choosing complicated tuning parameters or function approximation classes and it can adapt to local structure such as local change in dimensionality. We demonstrate the algorithm on both artificial and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces.",
    "In this paper, we prove a crucial theorem called Mirroring Theorem which affirms that given a collection of samples with enough information in it such that it can be classified into classes and subclasses then (i) There exists a mapping which classifies and subclassifies these samples (ii) There exists a hierarchical classifier which can be constructed by using Mirroring Neural Networks (MNNs) in combination with a clustering algorithm that can approximate this mapping. Thus, the proof of the Mirroring theorem provides a theoretical basis for the existence and a practical feasibility of constructing hierarchical classifiers, given the maps. Our proposed Mirroring Theorem can also be considered as an extension to Kolmogrovs theorem in providing a realistic solution for unsupervised classification. The techniques we develop, are general in nature and have led to the construction of learning machines which are (i) tree like in structure, (ii) modular (iii) with each module running on a common algorithm (tandem algorithm) and (iv) selfsupervised. We have actually built the architecture, developed the tandem algorithm of such a hierarchical classifier and demonstrated it on an example problem.",
    "This paper describes a methodology for detecting anomalies from sequentially observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach consists of two main elements: (1) {\\em filtering}, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy observations, and (2) {\\em hedging}, or flagging potential anomalies by comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive threshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an end user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work on online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions given all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter updates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game. We also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high dimensionality, as well as on the Enron email dataset.",
    "We present in this paper a study on the ability and the benefits of using a keystroke dynamics authentication method for collaborative systems. Authentication is a challenging issue in order to guarantee the security of use of collaborative systems during the access control step. Many solutions exist in the state of the art such as the use of one time passwords or smart-cards. We focus in this paper on biometric based solutions that do not necessitate any additional sensor. Keystroke dynamics is an interesting solution as it uses only the keyboard and is invisible for users. Many methods have been published in this field. We make a comparative study of many of them considering the operational constraints of use for collaborative systems.",
    "This document describes concisely the ubiquitous class of exponential family distributions met in statistics. The first part recalls definitions and summarizes main properties and duality with Bregman divergences (all proofs are skipped). The second part lists decompositions and related formula of common exponential family distributions. We recall the Fisher-Rao-Riemannian geometries and the dual affine connection information geometries of statistical manifolds. It is intended to maintain and update this document and catalog by adding new distribution items.",
    "One of the most popular algorithms for clustering in Euclidean space is the $k$-means algorithm; $k$-means is difficult to analyze mathematically, and few theoretical guarantees are known about it, particularly when the data is {\\em well-clustered}. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular, we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian -- or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.   We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption. First, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical Gaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the subspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm, when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical Gaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation between the mixture components.   Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2 spherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required by a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing separation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures of two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the sample requirement of $k$-means is {\\em near-optimal}.",
    "In this paper, we consider delay-optimal power and subcarrier allocation design for OFDMA systems with $N_F$ subcarriers, $K$ mobiles and one base station. There are $K$ queues at the base station for the downlink traffic to the $K$ mobiles with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We shall model the problem as a $K$-dimensional infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP) where the control actions are assumed to be a function of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) as well as the joint Queue State Information (QSI). This problem is challenging because it corresponds to a stochastic Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem where general solution is still unknown. We propose an {\\em online stochastic value iteration} solution using {\\em stochastic approximation}. The proposed power control algorithm, which is a function of both the CSI and the QSI, takes the form of multi-level water-filling. We prove that under two mild conditions in Theorem 1 (One is the stepsize condition. The other is the condition on accessibility of the Markov Chain, which can be easily satisfied in most of the cases we are interested.), the proposed solution converges to the optimal solution almost surely (with probability 1) and the proposed framework offers a possible solution to the general stochastic NUM problem. By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we obtain a reduced complexity decomposed solution with linear $\\mathcal{O}(KN_F)$ complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory requirement.",
    "Association rule mining plays vital part in knowledge mining. The difficult task is discovering knowledge or useful rules from the large number of rules generated for reduced support. For pruning or grouping rules, several techniques are used such as rule structure cover methods, informative cover methods, rule clustering, etc. Another way of selecting association rules is based on interestingness measures such as support, confidence, correlation, and so on. In this paper, we study how rule clusters of the pattern Xi - Y are distributed over different interestingness measures.",
    "This paper presents a tumor detection algorithm from mammogram. The proposed system focuses on the solution of two problems. One is how to detect tumors as suspicious regions with a very weak contrast to their background and another is how to extract features which categorize tumors. The tumor detection method follows the scheme of (a) mammogram enhancement. (b) The segmentation of the tumor area. (c) The extraction of features from the segmented tumor area. (d) The use of SVM classifier. The enhancement can be defined as conversion of the image quality to a better and more understandable level. The mammogram enhancement procedure includes filtering, top hat operation, DWT. Then the contrast stretching is used to increase the contrast of the image. The segmentation of mammogram images has been playing an important role to improve the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The most common segmentation method used is thresholding. The features are extracted from the segmented breast area. Next stage include, which classifies the regions using the SVM classifier. The method was tested on 75 mammographic images, from the mini-MIAS database. The methodology achieved a sensitivity of 88.75%.",
    "Among all the partition based clustering algorithms K-means is the most popular and well known method. It generally shows impressive results even in considerably large data sets. The computational complexity of K-means does not suffer from the size of the data set. The main disadvantage faced in performing this clustering is that the selection of initial means. If the user does not have adequate knowledge about the data set, it may lead to erroneous results. The algorithm Automatic Initialization of Means (AIM), which is an extension to K-means, has been proposed to overcome the problem of initial mean generation. In this paper an attempt has been made to compare the performance of the algorithms through implementation",
    "Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.",
    "In this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing a hidden weighted hypergraph of constant rank using additive queries. We prove the following: Let $G$ be a weighted hidden hypergraph of constant rank with n vertices and $m$ hyperedges. For any $m$ there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\\frac{m\\log n}{\\log m}) $$ additive queries. This solves the open problem in [S. Choi, J. H. Kim. Optimal Query Complexity Bounds for Finding Graphs. {\\em STOC}, 749--758,~2008].   When the weights of the hypergraph are integers that are less than $O(poly(n^d/m))$ where $d$ is the rank of the hypergraph (and therefore for unweighted hypergraphs) there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\\frac{m\\log \\frac{n^d}{m}}{\\log m}). $$ additive queries.   Using the information theoretic bound the above query complexities are tight.",
    "Multi-class classification is one of the most important tasks in machine learning. In this paper we consider two online multi-class classification problems: classification by a linear model and by a kernelized model. The quality of predictions is measured by the Brier loss function. We suggest two computationally efficient algorithms to work with these problems and prove theoretical guarantees on their losses. We kernelize one of the algorithms and prove theoretical guarantees on its loss. We perform experiments and compare our algorithms with logistic regression.",
    "Discovering latent representations of the observed world has become increasingly more relevant in data analysis. Much of the effort concentrates on building latent variables which can be used in prediction problems, such as classification and regression. A related goal of learning latent structure from data is that of identifying which hidden common causes generate the observations, such as in applications that require predicting the effect of policies. This will be the main problem tackled in our contribution: given a dataset of indicators assumed to be generated by unknown and unmeasured common causes, we wish to discover which hidden common causes are those, and how they generate our data. This is possible under the assumption that observed variables are linear functions of the latent causes with additive noise. Previous results in the literature present solutions for the case where each observed variable is a noisy function of a single latent variable. We show how to extend the existing results for some cases where observed variables measure more than one latent variable.",
    "Bayes statistics and statistical physics have the common mathematical structure, where the log likelihood function corresponds to the random Hamiltonian. Recently, it was discovered that the asymptotic learning curves in Bayes estimation are subject to a universal law, even if the log likelihood function can not be approximated by any quadratic form. However, it is left unknown what mathematical property ensures such a universal law. In this paper, we define a renormalizable condition of the statistical estimation problem, and show that, under such a condition, the asymptotic learning curves are ensured to be subject to the universal law, even if the true distribution is unrealizable and singular for a statistical model. Also we study a nonrenormalizable case, in which the learning curves have the different asymptotic behaviors from the universal law.",
    "Associative Classifier is a novel technique which is the integration of Association Rule Mining and Classification. The difficult task in building Associative Classifier model is the selection of relevant rules from a large number of class association rules (CARs). A very popular method of ordering rules for selection is based on confidence, support and antecedent size (CSA). Other methods are based on hybrid orderings in which CSA method is combined with other measures. In the present work, we study the effect of using different interestingness measures of Association rules in CAR rule ordering and selection for associative classifier.",
    "This paper presents a framework aimed at monitoring the behavior of aircraft in a given airspace. Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC) to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the runway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in real time. The airspace is \"healthy\" when all aircraft are flying according to the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to ensure a safe separation between aircraft.",
    "The paper deals with on-line regression settings with signals belonging to a Banach lattice. Our algorithms work in a semi-online setting where all the inputs are known in advance and outcomes are unknown and given step by step. We apply the Aggregating Algorithm to construct a prediction method whose cumulative loss over all the input vectors is comparable with the cumulative loss of any linear functional on the Banach lattice. As a by-product we get an algorithm that takes signals from an arbitrary domain. Its cumulative loss is comparable with the cumulative loss of any predictor function from Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We describe several applications of our setting.",
    "The performance in higher secondary school education in India is a turning point in the academic lives of all students. As this academic performance is influenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining model for students' performance so as to identify the slow learners and study the influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. In the present investigation, a survey cum experimental methodology was adopted to generate a database and it was constructed from a primary and a secondary source. While the primary data was collected from the regular students, the secondary data was gathered from the school and office of the Chief Educational Officer (CEO). A total of 1000 datasets of the year 2006 from five different schools in three different districts of Tamilnadu were collected. The raw data was preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in one form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result, we had 772 student records, which were used for CHAID prediction model construction. A set of prediction rules were extracted from CHIAD prediction model and the efficiency of the generated CHIAD prediction model was found. The accuracy of the present model was compared with other model and it has been found to be satisfactory.",
    "The recent increase in dimensionality of data has thrown a great challenge to the existing dimensionality reduction methods in terms of their effectiveness. Dimensionality reduction has emerged as one of the significant preprocessing steps in machine learning applications and has been effective in removing inappropriate data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving comprehensibility. Feature redundancy exercises great influence on the performance of classification process. Towards the better classification performance, this paper addresses the usefulness of truncating the highly correlated and redundant attributes. Here, an effort has been made to verify the utility of dimensionality reduction by applying LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) method on two Benchmark datasets of 'Pima Indian Diabetic patients' and 'Lung cancer patients'.",
    "A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in order to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate prediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many applications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from data, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks solving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible, and thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present Distributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for repeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility of the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees that apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural diminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely low communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We extend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several real-world sensing tasks.",
    "Recently Kutin and Niyogi investigated several notions of algorithmic stability--a property of a learning map conceptually similar to continuity--showing that training-stability is sufficient for consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization while distribution-free CV-stability is necessary and sufficient for having finite VC-dimension. This paper concerns a phase transition in the training stability of ERM, conjectured by the same authors. Kutin and Niyogi proved that ERM on finite hypothesis spaces containing a unique risk minimizer has training stability that scales exponentially with sample size, and conjectured that the existence of multiple risk minimizers prevents even super-quadratic convergence. We prove this result for the strictly weaker notion of CV-stability, positively resolving the conjecture.",
    "We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly. We introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also with non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the (highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset.",
    "We introduce a natural generalization of submodular set cover and exact active learning with a finite hypothesis class (query learning). We call this new problem interactive submodular set cover. Applications include advertising in social networks with hidden information. We give an approximation guarantee for a novel greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which matches up to constant factors. We also discuss negative results for simpler approaches and present encouraging early experimental results.",
    "India is a multi-lingual country where Roman script is often used alongside different Indic scripts in a text document. To develop a script specific handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, it is therefore necessary to identify the scripts of handwritten text correctly. In this paper, we present a system, which automatically separates the scripts of handwritten words from a document, written in Bangla or Devanagri mixed with Roman scripts. In this script separation technique, we first, extract the text lines and words from document pages using a script independent Neighboring Component Analysis technique. Then we have designed a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier for script separation, trained with 8 different wordlevel holistic features. Two equal sized datasets, one with Bangla and Roman scripts and the other with Devanagri and Roman scripts, are prepared for the system evaluation. On respective independent text samples, word-level script identification accuracies of 99.29% and 98.43% are achieved.",
    "We address the problem of learning in an online, bandit setting where the learner must repeatedly select among $K$ actions, but only receives partial feedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a new algorithm called Exp4.P, we show that it is possible to compete with the best in a set of $N$ experts with probability $1-\\delta$ while incurring regret at most $O(\\sqrt{KT\\ln(N/\\delta)})$ over $T$ time steps. The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension $d$ while incurring regret at most $O(\\sqrt{T(d\\ln(T) + \\ln (1/\\delta))})$ with probability $1-\\delta$. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the contextual bandit setting.",
    "We introduce a new online convex optimization algorithm that adaptively chooses its regularization function based on the loss functions observed so far. This is in contrast to previous algorithms that use a fixed regularization function such as L2-squared, and modify it only via a single time-dependent parameter. Our algorithm's regret bounds are worst-case optimal, and for certain realistic classes of loss functions they are much better than existing bounds. These bounds are problem-dependent, which means they can exploit the structure of the actual problem instance. Critically, however, our algorithm does not need to know this structure in advance. Rather, we prove competitive guarantees that show the algorithm provides a bound within a constant factor of the best possible bound (of a certain functional form) in hindsight.",
    "Semisupervised learning has emerged as a popular framework for improving modeling accuracy while controlling labeling cost. Based on an extension of stochastic composite likelihood we quantify the asymptotic accuracy of generative semi-supervised learning. In doing so, we complement distribution-free analysis by providing an alternative framework to measure the value associated with different labeling policies and resolve the fundamental question of how much data to label and in what manner. We demonstrate our approach with both simulation studies and real world experiments using naive Bayes for text classification and MRFs and CRFs for structured prediction in NLP.",
    "Many popular linear classifiers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled dataset. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional datasets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classifiers in transfer learning, and for training classifiers with no labeled data whatsoever.",
    "A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to automatically select the \"right\" model complexity, e.g., the number of neighbors to be averaged over in k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree in regression with polynomials. We suggest a novel principle - the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) - for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better. LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC, BIC, MDL), LoRP depends only on the regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN.",
    "Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random fields. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators when the computational resources are insufficient. They also demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy.",
    "We present an approach to semi-supervised learning based on an exponential family characterization. Our approach generalizes previous work on coupled priors for hybrid generative/discriminative models. Our model is more flexible and natural than previous approaches. Experimental results on several data sets show that our approach also performs better in practice.",
    "In recent years, predicting the user's next request in web navigation has received much attention. An information source to be used for dealing with such problem is the left information by the previous web users stored at the web access log on the web servers. Purposed systems for this problem work based on this idea that if a large number of web users request specific pages of a website on a given session, it can be concluded that these pages are satisfying similar information needs, and therefore they are conceptually related. In this study, a new clustering approach is introduced that employs logical path storing of a website pages as another parameter which is regarded as a similarity parameter and conceptual relation between web pages. The results of simulation have shown that the proposed approach is more than others precise in determining the clusters.",
    "Most Web page classification models typically apply the bag of words (BOW) model to represent the feature space. The original BOW representation, however, is unable to recognize semantic relationships between terms. One possible solution is to apply the topic model approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to cluster the term features into a set of latent topics. Terms assigned into the same topic are semantically related. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification method based on a topic model and by integrating additional term features from neighboring pages. Our hierarchical classification method consists of two phases: (1) feature representation by using a topic model and integrating neighboring pages, and (2) hierarchical Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification model constructed from a confusion matrix. From the experimental results, the approach of using the proposed hierarchical SVM model by integrating current page with neighboring pages via the topic model yielded the best performance with the accuracy equal to 90.33% and the F1 measure of 90.14%; an improvement of 5.12% and 5.13% over the original SVM model, respectively.",
    "We apply the method of defensive forecasting, based on the use of game-theoretic supermartingales, to prediction with expert advice. In the traditional setting of a countable number of experts and a finite number of outcomes, the Defensive Forecasting Algorithm is very close to the well-known Aggregating Algorithm. Not only the performance guarantees but also the predictions are the same for these two methods of fundamentally different nature. We discuss also a new setting where the experts can give advice conditional on the learner's future decision. Both the algorithms can be adapted to the new setting and give the same performance guarantees as in the traditional setting. Finally, we outline an application of defensive forecasting to a setting with several loss functions.",
    "This paper proposes a novel similarity measure for clustering sequential data. We first construct a common state-space by training a single probabilistic model with all the sequences in order to get a unified representation for the dataset. Then, distances are obtained attending to the transition matrices induced by each sequence in that state-space. This approach solves some of the usual overfitting and scalability issues of the existing semi-parametric techniques, that rely on training a model for each sequence. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the advantages of the proposed similarity measure for clustering sequences.",
    "In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to $2\\lambda/n$, where $\\lambda$ is the real log canonical threshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.",
    "We present a solution to the problem of understanding a system that produces a sequence of temporally ordered observations. Our solution is based on generating and interpreting a set of temporal decision rules. A temporal decision rule is a decision rule that can be used to predict or retrodict the value of a decision attribute, using condition attributes that are observed at times other than the decision attribute's time of observation. A rule set, consisting of a set of temporal decision rules with the same decision attribute, can be interpreted by our Temporal Investigation Method for Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS) to signify an instantaneous, an acausal or a possibly causal relationship between the condition attributes and the decision attribute. We show the effectiveness of our method, by describing a number of experiments with both synthetic and real temporal data.",
    "In this work we investigate the relationship between Bregman distances and regularized Logistic Regression model. We present a detailed study of Bregman Distance minimization, a family of generalized entropy measures associated with convex functions. We convert the L1-regularized logistic regression into this more general framework and propose a primal-dual method based algorithm for learning the parameters. We pose L1-regularized logistic regression into Bregman distance minimization and then apply non-linear constrained optimization techniques to estimate the parameters of the logistic model.",
    "We describe and analyze efficient algorithms for learning a linear predictor from examples when the learner can only view a few attributes of each training example. This is the case, for instance, in medical research, where each patient participating in the experiment is only willing to go through a small number of tests. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufficient to compensate for the lack of full information on each training example. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms by showing that when running on digit recognition data, they obtain a high prediction accuracy even when the learner gets to see only four pixels of each image.",
    "We present a new latent-variable model employing a Gaussian mixture integrated with a feature selection procedure (the Bernoulli part of the model) which together form a \"Latent Bernoulli-Gauss\" distribution. The model is applied to MAP estimation, clustering, feature selection and collaborative filtering and fares favorably with the state-of-the-art latent-variable models.",
    "We address in this paper the problem of multi-channel signal sequence labeling. In particular, we consider the problem where the signals are contaminated by noise or may present some dephasing with respect to their labels. For that, we propose to jointly learn a SVM sample classifier with a temporal filtering of the channels. This will lead to a large margin filtering that is adapted to the specificity of each channel (noise and time-lag). We derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem and we discuss different filter regularizations for automated scaling or selection of channels. Our approach is tested on a non-linear toy example and on a BCI dataset. Results show that the classification performance on these problems can be improved by learning a large margin filtering.",
    "We show that the learning sample complexity of a sigmoidal neural network constructed by Sontag (1992) required to achieve a given misclassification error under a fixed purely atomic distribution can grow arbitrarily fast: for any prescribed rate of growth there is an input distribution having this rate as the sample complexity, and the bound is asymptotically tight. The rate can be superexponential, a non-recursive function, etc. We further observe that Sontag's ANN is not Glivenko-Cantelli under any input distribution having a non-atomic part.",
    "This paper introduces a principled approach for the design of a scalable general reinforcement learning agent. This approach is based on a direct approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension of the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a number of stochastic, unknown, and partially observable domains.",
    "Search engines today present results that are often oblivious to abrupt shifts in intent. For example, the query `independence day' usually refers to a US holiday, but the intent of this query abruptly changed during the release of a major film by that name. While no studies exactly quantify the magnitude of intent-shifting traffic, studies suggest that news events, seasonal topics, pop culture, etc account for 50% of all search queries. This paper shows that the signals a search engine receives can be used to both determine that a shift in intent has happened, as well as find a result that is now more relevant. We present a meta-algorithm that marries a classifier with a bandit algorithm to achieve regret that depends logarithmically on the number of query impressions, under certain assumptions. We provide strong evidence that this regret is close to the best achievable. Finally, via a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms prior approaches, particularly as the amount of intent-shifting traffic increases.",
    "Recently, applying the novel data mining techniques for evaluating enterprise financial distress has received much research alternation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and back propagation neural (BPN) network has been applied successfully in many areas with excellent generalization results, such as rule extraction, classification and evaluation. In this paper, a model based on SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel is proposed here for enterprise financial distress evaluation. BPN network is considered one of the simplest and are most general methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural network. The comparative results show that through the difference between the performance measures is marginal; SVM gives higher precision and lower error rates.",
    "Most image-search approaches today are based on the text based tags associated with the images which are mostly human generated and are subject to various kinds of errors. The results of a query to the image database thus can often be misleading and may not satisfy the requirements of the user. In this work we propose our approach to automate this tagging process of images, where image results generated can be fine filtered based on a probabilistic tagging mechanism. We implement a tool which helps to automate the tagging process by maintaining a training database, wherein the system is trained to identify certain set of input images, the results generated from which are used to create a probabilistic tagging mechanism. Given a certain set of segments in an image it calculates the probability of presence of particular keywords. This probability table is further used to generate the candidate tags for input images.",
    "We present a framework for discriminative sequence classification where the learner works directly in the high dimensional predictor space of all subsequences in the training set. This is possible by employing a new coordinate-descent algorithm coupled with bounding the magnitude of the gradient for selecting discriminative subsequences fast. We characterize the loss functions for which our generic learning algorithm can be applied and present concrete implementations for logistic regression (binomial log-likelihood loss) and support vector machines (squared hinge loss). Application of our algorithm to protein remote homology detection and remote fold recognition results in performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., kernel support vector machines). Unlike state-of-the-art classifiers, the resulting classification models are simply lists of weighted discriminative subsequences and can thus be interpreted and related to the biological problem.",
    "We present three generalisations of Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) which incorporate knowledge of the class labels of a subset of the data points. The first, MV-KPCA, penalises within class variances similar to Fisher discriminant analysis. The second, LSKPCA is a hybrid of least squares regression and kernel PCA. The final LR-KPCA is an iteratively reweighted version of the previous which achieves a sigmoid loss function on the labeled points. We provide a theoretical risk bound as well as illustrative experiments on real and toy data sets.",
    "In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be bounded in advance. We present some modification of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled fluctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled fluctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero.",
    "In prediction with expert advice the goal is to design online prediction algorithms that achieve small regret (additional loss on the whole data) compared to a reference scheme. In the simplest such scheme one compares to the loss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the data into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is appropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard fixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this scheme.   Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about how they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the following question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from data in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first case. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly when the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending fixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T outcomes. We show, however, that no such slowdown is necessary if the experts are hidden Markov models.",
    "A problem posed by Freund is how to efficiently track a small pool of experts out of a much larger set. This problem was solved when Bousquet and Warmuth introduced their mixing past posteriors (MPP) algorithm in 2001.   In Freund's problem the experts would normally be considered black boxes. However, in this paper we re-examine Freund's problem in case the experts have internal structure that enables them to learn. In this case the problem has two possible interpretations: should the experts learn from all data or only from the subsequence on which they are being tracked? The MPP algorithm solves the first case. Our contribution is to generalise MPP to address the second option. The results we obtain apply to any expert structure that can be formalised using (expert) hidden Markov models. Curiously enough, for our interpretation there are \\emph{two} natural reference schemes: freezing and sleeping. For each scheme, we provide an efficient prediction strategy and prove the relevant loss bound.",
    "We propose a novel feature selection strategy to discover language-independent acoustic features that tend to be responsible for emotions regardless of languages, linguistics and other factors. Experimental results suggest that the language-independent feature subset discovered yields the performance comparable to the full feature set on various emotional speech corpora.",
    "The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",
    "This paper introduces an approach to Reinforcement Learning Algorithm by comparing their immediate rewards using a variation of Q-Learning algorithm. Unlike the conventional Q-Learning, the proposed algorithm compares current reward with immediate reward of past move and work accordingly. Relative reward based Q-learning is an approach towards interactive learning. Q-Learning is a model free reinforcement learning method that used to learn the agents. It is observed that under normal circumstances algorithm take more episodes to reach optimal Q-value due to its normal reward or sometime negative reward. In this new form of algorithm agents select only those actions which have a higher immediate reward signal in comparison to previous one. The contribution of this article is the presentation of new Q-Learning Algorithm in order to maximize the performance of algorithm and reduce the number of episode required to reach optimal Q-value. Effectiveness of proposed algorithm is simulated in a 20 x20 Grid world deterministic environment and the result for the two forms of Q-Learning Algorithms is given.",
    "We study three families of online convex optimization algorithms: follow-the-proximally-regularized-leader (FTRL-Proximal), regularized dual averaging (RDA), and composite-objective mirror descent. We first prove equivalence theorems that show all of these algorithms are instantiations of a general FTRL update. This provides theoretical insight on previous experimental observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent algorithm handles L1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that RDA is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds, leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two, and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.   Our second contribution is a unified analysis which produces regret bounds that match (up to logarithmic terms) or improve the best previously known bounds. This analysis also extends these algorithms in two important ways: we support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit updates, which replace the subgradient approximation of the current loss function with an exact optimization.",
    "We propose a novel hybrid loss for multiclass and structured prediction problems that is a convex combination of log loss for Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and a multiclass hinge loss for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We provide a sufficient condition for when the hybrid loss is Fisher consistent for classification. This condition depends on a measure of dominance between labels - specifically, the gap in per observation probabilities between the most likely labels. We also prove Fisher consistency is necessary for parametric consistency when learning models such as CRFs.   We demonstrate empirically that the hybrid loss typically performs as least as well as - and often better than - both of its constituent losses on variety of tasks. In doing so we also provide an empirical comparison of the efficacy of probabilistic and margin based approaches to multiclass and structured prediction and the effects of label dominance on these results.",
    "In this paper we present a new algorithm for learning oblique decision trees. Most of the current decision tree algorithms rely on impurity measures to assess the goodness of hyperplanes at each node while learning a decision tree in a top-down fashion. These impurity measures do not properly capture the geometric structures in the data. Motivated by this, our algorithm uses a strategy to assess the hyperplanes in such a way that the geometric structure in the data is taken into account. At each node of the decision tree, we find the clustering hyperplanes for both the classes and use their angle bisectors as the split rule at that node. We show through empirical studies that this idea leads to small decision trees and better performance. We also present some analysis to show that the angle bisectors of clustering hyperplanes that we use as the split rules at each node, are solutions of an interesting optimization problem and hence argue that this is a principled method of learning a decision tree.",
    "Margin theory provides one of the most popular explanations to the success of \\texttt{AdaBoost}, where the central point lies in the recognition that \\textit{margin} is the key for characterizing the performance of \\texttt{AdaBoost}. This theory has been very influential, e.g., it has been used to argue that \\texttt{AdaBoost} usually does not overfit since it tends to enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. Previously the \\textit{minimum margin bound} was established for \\texttt{AdaBoost}, however, \\cite{Breiman1999} pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin does not necessarily lead to a better generalization. Later, \\cite{Reyzin:Schapire2006} emphasized that the margin distribution rather than minimum margin is crucial to the performance of \\texttt{AdaBoost}. In this paper, we first present the \\textit{$k$th margin bound} and further study on its relationship to previous work such as the minimum margin bound and Emargin bound. Then, we improve the previous empirical Bernstein bounds \\citep{Maurer:Pontil2009,Audibert:Munos:Szepesvari2009}, and based on such findings, we defend the margin-based explanation against Breiman's doubts by proving a new generalization error bound that considers exactly the same factors as \\cite{Schapire:Freund:Bartlett:Lee1998} but is sharper than \\cite{Breiman1999}'s minimum margin bound. By incorporating factors such as average margin and variance, we present a generalization error bound that is heavily related to the whole margin distribution. We also provide margin distribution bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite VC-dimension space.",
    "In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for multiclass boosting learning. In the literature, AdaBoost.MO and AdaBoost.ECC are the two successful multiclass boosting algorithms, which can use binary weak learners. We explicitly derive these two algorithms' Lagrange dual problems based on their regularized loss functions. We show that the Lagrange dual formulations enable us to design totally-corrective multiclass algorithms by using the primal-dual optimization technique. Experiments on benchmark data sets suggest that our multiclass boosting can achieve a comparable generalization capability with state-of-the-art, but the convergence speed is much faster than stage-wise gradient descent boosting. In other words, the new totally corrective algorithms can maximize the margin more aggressively.",
    "Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.",
    "Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.",
    "We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",
    "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.",
    "To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime.",
    "Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.",
    "A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.",
    "Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms.",
    "The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding value.",
    "The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.",
    "We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger trees.",
    "This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is being used in practical applications. In order to deal efficiently with individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs, which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.",
    "In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far.",
    "Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods.",
    "Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance.",
    "This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.",
    "This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.",
    "The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text, producing a structured representation of selected information from the text. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain.",
    "This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.",
    "For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.",
    "Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k ``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems.",
    "The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.",
    "Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",
    "This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search.",
    "Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.",
    "Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.",
    "We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system, without use of either central coordination or explicit communication. We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency.",
    "Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.",
    "We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs.",
    "In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses.",
    "There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the \"best\" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies.",
    "This paper presents a method for inducing logic programs from examples that learns a new class of concepts called first-order decision lists, defined as ordered lists of clauses each ending in a cut. The method, called FOIDL, is based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous methods (both connectionist and symbolic).",
    "ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.",
    "Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems.",
    "Learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be intelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems.",
    "This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.",
    "Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.",
    "Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value.",
    "This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.",
    "OPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not significant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of potential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely specified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other areas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance.",
    "The main aim of this work is the development of a vision-based road detection system fast enough to cope with the difficult real-time constraints imposed by moving vehicle applications. The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures. The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template; a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function. The distorted template is the process output.",
    "In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.",
    "We present a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled foundation for causal reasoning. Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning.",
    "Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it.",
    "This article describes an application of three well-known statistical methods in the field of game-tree search: using a large number of classified Othello positions, feature weights for evaluation functions with a game-phase-independent meaning are estimated by means of logistic regression, Fisher's linear discriminant, and the quadratic discriminant function for normally distributed features. Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello program. In this application, logistic regression - which is used here for the first time in the context of game playing - leads to better results than the other approaches.",
    "We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance.",
    "Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size.",
    "The paper describes an extension of well-founded semantics for logic programs with two types of negation. In this extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically. This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique. Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic programs can be computed in polynomial time. A legal reasoning example illustrates the usefulness of the approach.",
    "Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.",
    "We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems.",
    "We develop a mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks based on ideas from statistical mechanics. Our mean field theory provides a tractable approximation to the true probability distribution in these networks; it also yields a lower bound on the likelihood of evidence. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on a benchmark problem in statistical pattern recognition---the classification of handwritten digits.",
    "A reported weakness of C4.5 in domains with continuous attributes is addressed by modifying the formation and evaluation of tests on continuous attributes. An MDL-inspired penalty is applied to such tests, eliminating some of them from consideration and altering the relative desirability of all tests. Empirical trials show that the modifications lead to smaller decision trees with higher predictive accuracies. Results also confirm that a new version of C4.5 incorporating these changes is superior to recent approaches that use global discretization and that construct small trees with multi-interval splits.",
    "For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.",
    "Inductive theorem provers often diverge. This paper describes a simple critic, a computer program which monitors the construction of inductive proofs attempting to identify diverging proof attempts. Divergence is recognized by means of a ``difference matching'' procedure. The critic then proposes lemmas and generalizations which ``ripple'' these differences away so that the proof can go through without divergence. The critic enables the theorem prover Spike to prove many theorems completely automatically from the definitions alone.",
    "Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs.",
    "Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions.",
    "This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning.",
    "The main operations in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are generalization and specialization, which only make sense in a generality order. In ILP, the three most important generality orders are subsumption, implication and implication relative to background knowledge. The two languages used most often are languages of clauses and languages of only Horn clauses. This gives a total of six different ordered languages. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free. Thirdly, we give a complete discussion of existence and non-existence of greatest specializations in each of the six ordered languages.",
    "This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.",
    "Although most scheduling problems are NP-hard, domain specific techniques perform well in practice but are quite expensive to construct. In adaptive problem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically for a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this approach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for one well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem distribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to scheduling satellite communications. Using problem distributions based on actual mission requirements, our approach identifies strategies that not only decrease the amount of CPU time required to produce schedules, but also increase the percentage of problems that are solvable within computational resource limitations.",
    "Speedup learning seeks to improve the computational efficiency of problem solving with experience. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge, namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle. This work integrates many strands of experimental and theoretical work in machine learning, including empirical learning of control rules, macro-operator learning, Explanation-Based Learning (EBL), and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning.",
    "A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.",
    "An important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the configuration of a collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a set of given constraints. Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of writing plan fragments. In this paper we address this limitation by showing how these plan fragments can be automatically synthesized using first principles about geometric bodies, actions, and topology.",
    "Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine their relationship.",
    "Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.",
    "Finding the stable models of a knowledge base is a significant computational problem in artificial intelligence. This task is at the computational heart of truth maintenance systems, autoepistemic logic, and default logic. Unfortunately, it is NP-hard. In this paper we present a hierarchy of classes of knowledge bases, Omega_1,Omega_2,..., with the following properties: first, Omega_1 is the class of all stratified knowledge bases; second, if a knowledge base Pi is in Omega_k, then Pi has at most k stable models, and all of them may be found in time O(lnk), where l is the length of the knowledge base and n the number of atoms in Pi; third, for an arbitrary knowledge base Pi, we can find the minimum k such that Pi belongs to Omega_k in time polynomial in the size of Pi; and, last, where K is the class of all knowledge bases, it is the case that union{i=1 to infty} Omega_i = K, that is, every knowledge base belongs to some class in the hierarchy.",
    "We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.",
    "Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.",
    "This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes.",
    "First-order learning involves finding a clause-form definition of a relation from examples of the relation and relevant background information. In this paper, a particular first-order learning system is modified to customize it for finding definitions of functional relations. This restriction leads to faster learning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive accuracy. Other first-order learning systems might benefit from similar specialization.",
    "This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP.",
    "A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.",
    "Efficiently entering information into a computer is key to enjoying the benefits of computing. This paper describes three intelligent user interfaces: handwriting recognition, adaptive menus, and predictive fillin. In the context of adding a personUs name and address to an electronic organizer, tests show handwriting recognition is slower than typing on an on-screen, soft keyboard, while adaptive menus and predictive fillin can be twice as fast. This paper also presents strategies for applying these three interfaces to other information collection domains.",
    "Decomposable dependency models possess a number of interesting and useful properties. This paper presents new characterizations of decomposable models in terms of independence relationships, which are obtained by adding a single axiom to the well-known set characterizing dependency models that are isomorphic to undirected graphs. We also briefly discuss a potential application of our results to the problem of learning graphical models from data.",
    "Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes.",
    "Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.",
    "Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.",
    "We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity. We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment.",
    "We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.",
    "An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks.",
    "Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.",
    "We investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra RCC-5 which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for spatial reasoning. The satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to be NP-complete but not much is known about its approximately four billion subclasses. We provide a complete classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal tractable subalgebras which are four in total.",
    "The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions.",
    "This paper combines two important directions of research in temporal resoning: that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra, and that of reasoning with metric temporal information. Eight new maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the recent framework of Horn DLRs. Two of the algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals, being the first such algebras admitting both qualitative and metric time.",
    "Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.",
    "Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results.",
    "SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences.",
    "Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.",
    "Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms.",
    "The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area.",
    "Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.",
    "The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.",
    "Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.",
    "An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.",
    "Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners.",
    "This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.",
    "In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms.",
    "In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.",
    "This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.",
    "One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size.",
    "We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with both flat and propositional representations. The complexity of plan evaluation and existence varies with the plan type sought; we examine totally ordered plans, acyclic plans, and looping plans, and partially ordered plans under three natural definitions of plan value. We show that problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: PL, P, NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. In the process of proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of problems.",
    "In this paper we describe SYNERGY, which is a highly parallelizable, linear planning system that is based on the genetic programming paradigm. Rather than reasoning about the world it is planning for, SYNERGY uses artificial selection, recombination and fitness measure to generate linear plans that solve conjunctive goals. We ran SYNERGY on several domains (e.g., the briefcase problem and a few variants of the robot navigation problem), and the experimental results show that our planner is capable of handling problem instances that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones solved by UCPOP. In order to facilitate the search reduction and to enhance the expressive power of SYNERGY, we also propose two major extensions to our planning system: a formalism for using hierarchical planning operators, and a framework for planning in dynamic environments.",
    "We show that several constraint propagation algorithms (also called (local) consistency, consistency enforcing, Waltz, filtering or narrowing algorithms) are instances of algorithms that deal with chaotic iteration. To this end we propose a simple abstract framework that allows us to classify and compare these algorithms and to establish in a uniform way their basic properties.",
    "This paper examines the phenomenon of daydreaming: spontaneously recalling or imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The following important roles of daydreaming in human cognition are postulated: plan preparation and rehearsal, learning from failures and successes, support for processes of creativity, emotion regulation, and motivation.   A computational theory of daydreaming and its implementation as the program DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes, and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday occurrences.   The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four control goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented: rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role of episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running.",
    "Real world combinatorial optimization problems such as scheduling are typically too complex to solve with exact methods. Additionally, the problems often have to observe vaguely specified constraints of different importance, the available data may be uncertain, and compromises between antagonistic criteria may be necessary. We present a combination of approximate reasoning based constraints and iterative optimization based heuristics that help to model and solve such problems in a framework of C++ software libraries called StarFLIP++. While initially developed to schedule continuous caster units in steel plants, we present in this paper results from reusing the library components in a shift scheduling system for the workforce of an industrial production plant.",
    "The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update.",
    "How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) \"iconic representations,\" which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) \"categorical representations,\" which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) \"symbolic representations,\" grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., \"An X is a Y that is Z\").",
    "In tree search problem the best-first search algorithm needs too much of space . To remove such drawbacks of these algorithms the IDA* was developed which is both space and time cost efficient. But again IDA* can give an optimal solution for real valued problems like Flow shop scheduling, Travelling Salesman and 0/1 Knapsack due to their real valued cost estimates. Thus further modifications are done on it and the Iterative Deepening Branch and Bound Search Algorithms is developed which meets the requirements. We have tried using this algorithm for the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem and have found that it is quite effective.",
    "Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \\emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \\emph{positive} agent programs.",
    "The assumptions needed to prove Cox's Theorem are discussed and examined. Various sets of assumptions under which a Cox-style theorem can be proved are provided, although all are rather strong and, arguably, not natural.",
    "We revisit the issue of connections between two leading formalisms in nonmonotonic reasoning: autoepistemic logic and default logic. For each logic we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief pair. The set of all belief pairs together with the so called knowledge ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind such approximations.",
    "Randomized algorithms for deciding satisfiability were shown to be effective in solving problems with thousands of variables. However, these algorithms are not complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment, if one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs.",
    "Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also mentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial biological code necessary open-ended evolution.",
    "This paper presents a method of computing a revision of a function-free normal logic program. If an added rule is inconsistent with a program, that is, if it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program, then deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We specify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive logic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure.",
    "This is a system description for the OSCAR defeasible reasoner.",
    "Diagnostic reasoning has been characterized logically as consistency-based reasoning or abductive reasoning. Previous analyses in the literature have shown, on the one hand, that choosing the (in general more restrictive) abductive definition may be appropriate or not, depending on the content of the knowledge base [Console&Torasso91], and, on the other hand, that, depending on the choice of the definition the same knowledge should be expressed in different form [Poole94].   Since in Model-Based Diagnosis a major problem is finding the right way of abstracting the behavior of the system to be modeled, this paper discusses the relation between modeling, and in particular abstraction in the model, and the notion of diagnosis.",
    "ACLP is a system which combines abductive reasoning and constraint solving by integrating the frameworks of Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). It forms a general high-level knowledge representation environment for abductive problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas. In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex problems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver for finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and scheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the direct use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it is built. These experiments provide evidence that the abductive framework of ACLP does not compromise significantly the computational efficiency of the solutions. Other experiments show the natural ability of ACLP to accommodate easily and in a robust way new or changing requirements of the original problem.",
    "We present a method for relevance sensitive non-monotonic inference from belief sequences which incorporates insights pertaining to prioritized inference and relevance sensitive, inconsistency tolerant belief revision.   Our model uses a finite, logically open sequence of propositional formulas as a representation for beliefs and defines a notion of inference from maxiconsistent subsets of formulas guided by two orderings: a temporal sequencing and an ordering based on relevance relations between the conclusion and formulas in the sequence. The relevance relations are ternary (using context as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The inference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by maintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers from a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between explicit and implicit beliefs. In doing so, it provides a finitely presented formalism and a plausible model of reasoning for automated agents.",
    "We propose a combination of probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with approaches to default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. In detail, we generalize the notions of Pearl's entailment in system Z, Lehmann's lexicographic entailment, and Geffner's conditional entailment to conditional constraints. We give some examples that show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment have similar properties like their classical counterparts. Moreover, we show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment are proper generalizations of both their classical counterparts and the classical notion of logical entailment for conditional constraints.",
    "This paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic programs into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an ordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among rules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since the result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic programming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular, PLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and smodels.",
    "The SLDNFA-system results from the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven, which investigates logics and proof procedures for these logics for declarative knowledge representation. Within this project inductive definition logic (ID-logic) is used as representation logic. Different solvers are being developed for this logic and one of these is SLDNFA. A prototype of the system is available and used for investigating how to solve efficiently problems represented in ID-logic.",
    "We describe an approach for compiling preferences into logic programs under the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Our approach allows both the specification of static orderings (as found in most previous work), in which preferences are external to a logic program, as well as orderings on sets of rules. In large part then, we are interested in describing a general methodology for uniformly incorporating preference information in a logic program. Since the result of our translation is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a compiler, available on the web, as a front-end for these programming systems.",
    "This paper proposes two kinds of fuzzy abductive inference in the framework of fuzzy rule base. The abductive inference processes described here depend on the semantic of the rule. We distinguish two classes of interpretation of a fuzzy rule, certainty generation rules and possible generation rules. In this paper we present the architecture of abductive inference in the first class of interpretation. We give two kinds of problem that we can resolve by using the proposed models of inference.",
    "The goal of the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven is to design an expressive logic, suitable for declarative knowledge representation, and to develop intelligent systems based on Logic Programming technology for solving computational problems using the declarative specifications. The ID-logic is an integration of typed classical logic and a definition logic. Different abductive solvers for this language are being developed. This paper is a report of the integration of high order aggregates into ID-logic and the consequences on the solver SLDNFA.",
    "We propose a new approach to belief revision that provides a way to change knowledge bases with a minimum of effort. We call this way of revising belief states optimal belief revision. Our revision method gives special attention to the fact that most belief revision processes are directed to a specific informational objective. This approach to belief change is founded on notions such as optimal context and accessibility. For the sentential model of belief states we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories determined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking of an arbitrary sentence in the language. Finally, we define the adjustment of the accessibility ranking of a revised base of a belief set.",
    "High-level robot controllers in realistic domains typically deal with processes which operate concurrently, change the world continuously, and where the execution of actions is event-driven as in ``charge the batteries as soon as the voltage level is low''. While non-logic-based robot control languages are well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to projecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are executed. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \\congolog, based on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has problems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these problems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support continuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \\ccgolog, a variant of \\congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One benefit of \\ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to non-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded projection mechanism.",
    "The Smodels system implements the stable model semantics for normal logic programs. It handles a subclass of programs which contain no function symbols and are domain-restricted but supports extensions including built-in functions as well as cardinality and weight constraints. On top of this core engine more involved systems can be built. As an example, we have implemented total and partial stable model computation for disjunctive logic programs. An interesting application method is based on answer set programming, i.e., encoding an application problem as a set of rules so that its solutions are captured by the stable models of the rules. Smodels has been applied to a number of areas including planning, model checking, reachability analysis, product configuration, dynamic constraint satisfaction, and feature interaction.",
    "E-RES is a system that implements the Language E, a logic for reasoning about narratives of action occurrences and observations. E's semantics is model-theoretic, but this implementation is based on a sound and complete reformulation of E in terms of argumentation, and uses general computational techniques of argumentation frameworks. The system derives sceptical non-monotonic consequences of a given reformulated theory which exactly correspond to consequences entailed by E's model-theory. The computation relies on a complimentary ability of the system to derive credulous non-monotonic consequences together with a set of supporting assumptions which is sufficient for the (credulous) conclusion to hold. E-RES allows theories to contain general action laws, statements about action occurrences, observations and statements of ramifications (or universal laws). It is able to derive consequences both forward and backward in time. This paper gives a short overview of the theoretical basis of E-RES and illustrates its use on a variety of examples. Currently, E-RES is being extended so that the system can be used for planning.",
    "In this paper, we outline the prototype of an automated inference tool, called QUIP, which provides a uniform implementation for several nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms. The theoretical basis of QUIP is derived from well-known results about the computational complexity of nonmonotonic logics and exploits a representation of the different reasoning tasks in terms of quantified boolean formulae.",
    "Over the past decade a considerable amount of research has been done to expand logic programming languages to handle incomplete information. One such language is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic programming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the general case. For extended disjunctive logic programs, an idea that has proven useful in simplifying the investigation of answer sets is the use of splitting sets. In this paper we will present an extended definition of splitting sets that will be applicable to epistemic specifications. Furthermore, an extension of the splitting set theorem will be presented. Also, a characterization of stratified epistemic specifications will be given in terms of splitting sets. This characterization leads us to an algorithmic method of computing world views of a subclass of epistemic logic programs.",
    "The US Data Encryption Standard, DES for short, is put forward as an interesting benchmark problem for nonmonotonic reasoning systems because (i) it provides a set of test cases of industrial relevance which shares features of randomly generated problems and real-world problems, (ii) the representation of DES using normal logic programs with the stable model semantics is simple and easy to understand, and (iii) this subclass of logic programs can be seen as an interesting special case for many other formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning. In this paper we present two encodings of DES as logic programs: a direct one out of the standard specifications and an optimized one extending the work of Massacci and Marraro. The computational properties of the encodings are studied by using them for DES key search with the Smodels system as the implementation of the stable model semantics. Results indicate that the encodings and Smodels are quite competitive: they outperform state-of-the-art SAT-checkers working with an optimized encoding of DES into SAT and are comparable with a SAT-checker that is customized and tuned for the optimized SAT encoding.",
    "We generalize a theorem by Francois Fages that describes the relationship between the completion semantics and the answer set semantics for logic programs with negation as failure. The study of this relationship is important in connection with the emergence of answer set programming. Whenever the two semantics are equivalent, answer sets can be computed by a satisfiability solver, and the use of answer set solvers such as smodels and dlv is unnecessary. A logic programming representation of the blocks world due to Ilkka Niemelae is discussed as an example.",
    "We introduced decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) recently as a tractable form of propositional theories, and provided a number of powerful logical operations that can be performed on it in polynomial time. We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories.",
    "The paper reports on first preliminary results and insights gained in a project aiming at implementing the fluent calculus using methods and techniques based on binary decision diagrams. After reporting on an initial experiment showing promising results we discuss our findings concerning various techniques and heuristics used to speed up the reasoning process.",
    "Planning is a natural domain of application for frameworks of reasoning about actions and change. In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known.",
    "In an earlier work, we have presented operations of belief change which only affect the relevant part of a belief base. In this paper, we propose the application of the same strategy to the problem of model-based diangosis. We first isolate the subset of the system description which is relevant for a given observation and then solve the diagnosis problem for this subset.",
    "We present a general, consistency-based framework for belief change. Informally, in revising K by A, we begin with A and incorporate as much of K as consistently possible. Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state; alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.   The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A.",
    "SATEN is an object-oriented web-based extraction and belief revision engine. It runs on any computer via a Java 1.1 enabled browser such as Netscape 4. SATEN performs belief revision based on the AGM approach. The extraction and belief revision reasoning engines operate on a user specified ranking of information. One of the features of SATEN is that it can be used to integrate mutually inconsistent commensuate rankings into a consistent ranking.",
    "Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm. We describe here an ASP system, DATALOG with constraints or DC, based on non-monotonic logic. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax, use and implementation of DC and provide experimental results.",
    "Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and combinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints. However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is competitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems, often yielding much more efficient solutions.",
    "We study here the well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints. First we propose a simple notion of completeness for sets of such rules and establish a completeness result. Then we show an equivalence in an appropriate sense between Boolean constraint propagation and unit propagation, a form of resolution for propositional logic.   Subsequently we characterize one set of such rules by means of the notion of hyper-arc consistency introduced in (Mohr and Masini 1988). Also, we clarify the status of a similar, though different, set of rules introduced in (Simonis 1989a) and more fully in (Codognet and Diaz 1996).",
    "A general notion of algebraic conditional plausibility measures is defined. Probability measures, ranking functions, possibility measures, and (under the appropriate definitions) sets of probability measures can all be viewed as defining algebraic conditional plausibility measures. It is shown that algebraic conditional plausibility measures can be represented using Bayesian networks.",
    "In this paper we present a rule based formalism for filtering variables domains of constraints. This formalism is well adapted for solving dynamic CSP. We take diagnosis as an instance problem to illustrate the use of these rules. A diagnosis problem is seen like finding all the minimal sets of constraints to be relaxed in the constraint network that models the device to be diagnosed",
    "Despite the effort of many researchers in the area of multi-agent systems (MAS) for designing and programming agents, a few years ago the research community began to take into account that common features among different MAS exists. Based on these common features, several tools have tackled the problem of agent development on specific application domains or specific types of agents. As a consequence, their scope is restricted to a subset of the huge application domain of MAS. In this paper we propose a generic infrastructure for programming agents whose name is Brainstorm/J. The infrastructure has been implemented as an object oriented framework. As a consequence, our approach supports a broader scope of MAS applications than previous efforts, being flexible and reusable.",
    "In fuzzy propositional logic, to a proposition a partial truth in [0,1] is assigned. It is well known that under certain circumstances, fuzzy logic collapses to classical logic. In this paper, we will show that under dual conditions, fuzzy logic collapses to four-valued (relevance) logic, where propositions have truth-value true, false, unknown, or contradiction. As a consequence, fuzzy entailment may be considered as ``in between'' four-valued (relevance) entailment and classical entailment.",
    "We propose a new definition of actual cause, using structural equations to model counterfactuals. We show that the definition yields a plausible and elegant account of causation that handles well examples which have caused problems for other definitions and resolves major difficulties in the traditional account.",
    "Many logic programming based approaches can be used to describe and solve combinatorial search problems. On the one hand there is constraint logic programming which computes a solution as an answer substitution to a query containing the variables of the constraint satisfaction problem. On the other hand there are systems based on stable model semantics, abductive systems, and first order logic model generators which compute solutions as models of some theory. This paper compares these different approaches from the point of view of knowledge representation (how declarative are the programs) and from the point of view of performance (how good are they at solving typical problems).",
    "In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning theory based on multi-channel parallel adaptation for rule discovery. This theory is distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition and hepatitis prognosis prediction.",
    "We present an approach for modelling the structure and coarse content of legal documents with a view to providing automated support for the drafting of contracts and contract database retrieval. The approach is designed to be applicable where contract drafting is based on model-form contracts or on existing examples of a similar type. The main features of the approach are: (1) the representation addresses the structure and the interrelationships between the constituent parts of contracts, but not the text of the document itself; (2) the representation of documents is separated from the mechanisms that manipulate it; and (3) the drafting process is subject to a collection of explicitly stated constraints that govern the structure of the documents. We describe the representation of document instances and of 'generic documents', which are data structures used to drive the creation of new document instances, and we show extracts from a sample session to illustrate the features of a prototype system implemented in MacProlog.",
    "One influential approach to assessing the \"goodness\" of arguments is offered by the Pragma-Dialectical school (p-d) (Eemeren & Grootendorst 1992). This can be compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an approach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text. An alternative approach for modelling argument structure is presented which not only caters for contractual text, but also overcomes the aforementioned limitations of RST.",
    "Information Integration is a young and exciting field with enormous research and commercial significance in the new world of the Information Society. It stands at the crossroad of Databases and Artificial Intelligence requiring novel techniques that bring together different methods from these fields. Information from disparate heterogeneous sources often with no a-priori common schema needs to be synthesized in a flexible, transparent and intelligent way in order to respond to the demands of a query thus enabling a more informed decision by the user or application program. The field although relatively young has already found many practical applications particularly for integrating information over the World Wide Web. This paper gives a brief introduction of the field highlighting some of the main current and future research issues and application areas. It attempts to evaluate the current and potential role of Computational Logic in this and suggests some of the problems where logic-based techniques could be used.",
    "Constraint propagation is a general algorithmic approach for pruning the search space of a CSP. In a uniform way, K. R. Apt has defined a computation as an iteration of reduction functions over a domain. He has also demonstrated the need for integrating static properties of reduction functions (commutativity and semi-commutativity) to design specialized algorithms such as AC3 and DAC. We introduce here a set of operators for modeling compositions of reduction functions. Two of the major goals are to tackle parallel computations, and dynamic behaviours (such as slow convergence).",
    "We consider an approach to update nonmonotonic knowledge bases represented as extended logic programs under answer set semantics. New information is incorporated into the current knowledge base subject to a causal rejection principle enforcing that, in case of conflicts, more recent rules are preferred and older rules are overridden. Such a rejection principle is also exploited in other approaches to update logic programs, e.g., in dynamic logic programming by Alferes et al. We give a thorough analysis of properties of our approach, to get a better understanding of the causal rejection principle. We review postulates for update and revision operators from the area of theory change and nonmonotonic reasoning, and some new properties are considered as well. We then consider refinements of our semantics which incorporate a notion of minimality of change. As well, we investigate the relationship to other approaches, showing that our approach is semantically equivalent to inheritance programs by Buccafurri et al. and that it coincides with certain classes of dynamic logic programs, for which we provide characterizations in terms of graph conditions. Therefore, most of our results about properties of causal rejection principle apply to these approaches as well. Finally, we deal with computational complexity of our approach, and outline how the update semantics and its refinements can be implemented on top of existing logic programming engines.",
    "We introduce a learning method called ``gradient-based reinforcement planning'' (GREP). Unlike traditional DP methods that improve their policy backwards in time, GREP is a gradient-based method that plans ahead and improves its policy before it actually acts in the environment. We derive formulas for the exact policy gradient that maximizes the expected future reward and confirm our ideas with numerical experiments.",
    "Much work in computer science has adopted competitive analysis as a tool for decision making under uncertainty. In this work we extend competitive analysis to the context of multi-agent systems. Unlike classical competitive analysis where the behavior of an agent's environment is taken to be arbitrary, we consider the case where an agent's environment consists of other agents. These agents will usually obey some (minimal) rationality constraints. This leads to the definition of rational competitive analysis. We introduce the concept of rational competitive analysis, and initiate the study of competitive analysis for multi-agent systems. We also discuss the application of rational competitive analysis to the context of bidding games, as well as to the classical one-way trading problem.",
    "This article aims at clarifying the language and practice of scientific experiment, mainly by hooking observability on calculability.",
    "Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The \"preferential\" models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper.",
    "This paper presents a logical approach to nonmonotonic reasoning based on the notion of a nonmonotonic consequence relation. A conditional knowledge base, consisting of a set of conditional assertions of the type \"if ... then ...\", represents the explicit defeasible knowledge an agent has about the way the world generally behaves. We look for a plausible definition of the set of all conditional assertions entailed by a conditional knowledge base. In a previous paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied \"preferential\" consequence relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class of consequence relations, \"rational\" relations. It is argued that any reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation. It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be represented by a \"ranked\" preferential model, or by a (non-standard) probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title. Global properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative operation. It is also computationally tractable. This paper assumes the underlying language is propositional.",
    "It is shown that Darwiche and Pearl's postulates imply an interesting property, not noticed by the authors.",
    "A vast and interesting family of natural semantics for belief revision is defined. Suppose one is given a distance d between any two models. One may then define the revision of a theory K by a formula a as the theory defined by the set of all those models of a that are closest, by d, to the set of models of K. This family is characterized by a set of rationality postulates that extends the AGM postulates. The new postulates describe properties of iterated revisions.",
    "We give a semantics to iterated update by a preference relation on possible developments. An iterated update is a sequence of formulas, giving (incomplete) information about successive states of the world. A development is a sequence of models, describing a possible trajectory through time. We assume a principle of inertia and prefer those developments, which are compatible with the information, and avoid unnecessary changes. The logical properties of the updates defined in this way are considered, and a representation result is proved.",
    "A. Tarski proposed the study of infinitary consequence operations as the central topic of mathematical logic. He considered monotonicity to be a property of all such operations. In this paper, we weaken the monotonicity requirement and consider more general operations, inference operations. These operations describe the nonmonotonic logics both humans and machines seem to be using when infering defeasible information from incomplete knowledge. We single out a number of interesting families of inference operations. This study of infinitary inference operations is inspired by the results of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor on finitary nonmonotonic operations, but this paper is self-contained.",
    "The Expansion property considered by researchers in Social Choice is shown to correspond to a logical property of nonmonotonic consequence relations that is the {\\em pure}, i.e., not involving connectives, version of a previously known weak rationality condition. The assumption that the union of two definable sets of models is definable is needed for the soundness part of the result.",
    "The lexicographic closure of any given finite set D of normal defaults is defined. A conditional assertion \"if a then b\" is in this lexicographic closure if, given the defaults D and the fact a, one would conclude b. The lexicographic closure is essentially a rational extension of D, and of its rational closure, defined in a previous paper. It provides a logic of normal defaults that is different from the one proposed by R. Reiter and that is rich enough not to require the consideration of non-normal defaults. A large number of examples are provided to show that the lexicographic closure corresponds to the basic intuitions behind Reiter's logic of defaults.",
    "We provide a characterization of those nonmonotonic inference operations C for which C(X) may be described as the set of all logical consequences of X together with some set of additional assumptions S(X) that depends anti-monotonically on X (i.e., X is a subset of Y implies that S(Y) is a subset of S(X)). The operations represented are exactly characterized in terms of properties most of which have been studied in Freund-Lehmann(cs.AI/0202031). Similar characterizations of right-absorbing and cumulative operations are also provided. For cumulative operations, our results fit in closely with those of Freund. We then discuss extending finitary operations to infinitary operations in a canonical way and discuss co-compactness properties. Our results provide a satisfactory notion of pseudo-compactness, generalizing to deductive nonmonotonic operations the notion of compactness for monotonic operations. They also provide an alternative, more elegant and more general, proof of the existence of an infinitary deductive extension for any finitary deductive operation (Theorem 7.9 of Freund-Lehmann).",
    "Stereotypical reasoning assumes that the situation at hand is one of a kind and that it enjoys the properties generally associated with that kind of situation. It is one of the most basic forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. A formal model for stereotypical reasoning is proposed and the logical properties of this form of reasoning are studied. Stereotypical reasoning is shown to be cumulative under weak assumptions.",
    "We introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler as a front-end for these programming systems.",
    "Prioritized default reasoning has illustrated its rich expressiveness and flexibility in knowledge representation and reasoning. However, many important aspects of prioritized default reasoning have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we investigate two properties of prioritized logic programs in the context of answer set semantics. Specifically, we reveal a close relationship between mutual defeasibility and uniqueness of the answer set for a prioritized logic program. We then explore how the splitting technique for extended logic programs can be extended to prioritized logic programs. We prove splitting theorems that can be used to simplify the evaluation of a prioritized logic program under certain conditions.",
    "The (extended) AGM postulates for belief revision seem to deal with the revision of a given theory K by an arbitrary formula, but not to constrain the revisions of two different theories by the same formula. A new postulate is proposed and compared with other similar postulates that have been proposed in the literature. The AGM revisions that satisfy this new postulate stand in one-to-one correspondence with the rational, consistency-preserving relations. This correspondence is described explicitly. Two viewpoints on iterative revisions are distinguished and discussed.",
    "We study fixpoints of operators on lattices. To this end we introduce the notion of an approximation of an operator. We order approximations by means of a precision ordering. We show that each lattice operator O has a unique most precise or ultimate approximation. We demonstrate that fixpoints of this ultimate approximation provide useful insights into fixpoints of the operator O.   We apply our theory to logic programming and introduce the ultimate Kripke-Kleene, well-founded and stable semantics. We show that the ultimate Kripke-Kleene and well-founded semantics are more precise then their standard counterparts We argue that ultimate semantics for logic programming have attractive epistemological properties and that, while in general they are computationally more complex than the standard semantics, for many classes of theories, their complexity is no worse.",
    "Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning. In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\\cal AT}^{0}, {\\cal AT}^{1} and {\\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\\cal A} language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action languages.",
    "An anticipatory system for guiding plot development in interactive narratives is described. The executable model is a finite automaton that provides the implemented system with a look-ahead. The identification of undesirable future states in the model is used to guide the player, in a transparent manner. In this way, too radical twists of the plot can be avoided. Since the player participates in the development of the plot, such guidance can have many forms, depending on the environment of the player, on the behavior of the other players, and on the means of player interaction. We present a design method for interactive narratives which produces designs suitable for the implementation of anticipatory mechanisms. Use of the method is illustrated by application to our interactive computer game Kaktus.",
    "Open logic programs and open entailment have been recently proposed as an abstract framework for the verification of incomplete specifications based upon normal logic programs and the stable model semantics. There are obvious analogies between open predicates and abducible predicates. However, despite superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly, open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming (ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and ASP.",
    "In this paper we consider three different kinds of domain-dependent control knowledge (temporal, procedural and HTN-based) that are useful in planning. Our approach is declarative and relies on the language of logic programming with answer set semantics (AnsProlog*). AnsProlog* is designed to plan without control knowledge. We show how temporal, procedural and HTN-based control knowledge can be incorporated into AnsProlog* by the modular addition of a small number of domain-dependent rules, without the need to modify the planner. We formally prove the correctness of our planner, both in the absence and presence of the control knowledge. Finally, we perform some initial experimentation that demonstrates the potential reduction in planning time that can be achieved when procedural domain knowledge is used to solve planning problems with large plan length.",
    "Dung's abstract framework for argumentation enables a study of the interactions between arguments based solely on an ``attack'' binary relation on the set of arguments. Various ways to solve conflicts between contradictory pieces of information have been proposed in the context of argumentation, nonmonotonic reasoning or logic programming, and can be captured by appropriate semantics within Dung's framework. A common feature of these semantics is that one can always maximize in some sense the set of acceptable arguments. We propose in this paper to extend Dung's framework in order to allow for the representation of what we call ``restricted'' arguments: these arguments should only be used if absolutely necessary, that is, in order to support other arguments that would otherwise be defeated. We modify Dung's preferred semantics accordingly: a set of arguments becomes acceptable only if it contains a minimum of restricted arguments, for a maximum of unrestricted arguments.",
    "We address a general representation problem for belief change, and describe two interrelated representations for iterative non-prioritized change: a logical representation in terms of persistent epistemic states, and a constructive representation in terms of flocks of bases.",
    "An extension of an abstract argumentation framework, called collective argumentation, is introduced in which the attack relation is defined directly among sets of arguments. The extension turns out to be suitable, in particular, for representing semantics of disjunctive logic programs. Two special kinds of collective argumentation are considered in which the opponents can share their arguments.",
    "Logic programs with ordered disjunction (LPODs) combine ideas underlying Qualitative Choice Logic (Brewka et al. KR 2002) and answer set programming. Logic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective called ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent alternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A \\times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at least B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a preference relation on answer sets. LPODs are useful for applications in design and configuration and can serve as a basis for qualitative decision making.",
    "In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a system.",
    "This paper studies the problem of modeling complex domains of actions and change within high-level action description languages. We investigate two main issues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of actions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its computational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are independent of the specific modeling language.",
    "This paper introduces the notion of value-based argumentation frameworks, an extension of the standard argumentation frameworks proposed by Dung, which are able toshow how rational decision is possible in cases where arguments derive their force from the social values their acceptance would promote.",
    "We analyze the problem of defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs within a general framework based on alternating fixpoint theory. We start by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to preference are too weak in the setting of well-founded semantics. We then specify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework for preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we indicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured within our semantical framework.",
    "In this paper we present a transformation of finite propositional default theories into so-called propositional argumentation systems. This transformation allows to characterize all notions of Reiter's default logic in the framework of argumentation systems. As a consequence, computing extensions, or determining wether a given formula belongs to one extension or all extensions can be answered without leaving the field of classical propositional logic. The transformation proposed is linear in the number of defaults.",
    "In the present paper, the existence and multiplicity problems of extensions are addressed. The focus is on extension of the stable type. The main result of the paper is an elegant characterization of the existence and multiplicity of extensions in terms of the notion of dialectical justification, a close cousin of the notion of admissibility. The characterization is given in the context of the particular logic for dialectical argumentation DEFLOG. The results are of direct relevance for several well-established models of defeasible reasoning (like default logic, logic programming and argumentation frameworks), since elsewhere dialectical argumentation has been shown to have close formal connections with these models.",
    "Recently, it has been shown that probabilistic entailment under coherence is weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment. Moreover, probabilistic entailment under coherence is a generalization of default entailment in System P. In this paper, we continue this line of research by presenting probabilistic generalizations of more sophisticated notions of classical default entailment that lie between model-theoretic probabilistic entailment and probabilistic entailment under coherence. That is, the new formalisms properly generalize their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision. More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the well-known standard ones.",
    "We seek to find normative criteria of adequacy for nonmonotonic logic similar to the criterion of validity for deductive logic. Rather than stipulating that the conclusion of an inference be true in all models in which the premises are true, we require that the conclusion of a nonmonotonic inference be true in ``almost all'' models of a certain sort in which the premises are true. This ``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the inference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and previous inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect known frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default inference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an extension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise result from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when construed in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default rules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics.",
    "About ten years ago, various notions of preferential entailment have been introduced. The main reference is a paper by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (KLM), one of the main competitor being a more general version defined by Makinson (MAK). These two versions have already been compared, but it is time to revisit these comparisons. Here are our three main results: (1) These two notions are equivalent, provided that we restrict our attention, as done in KLM, to the cases where the entailment respects logical equivalence (on the left and on the right). (2) A serious simplification of the description of the fundamental cases in which MAK is equivalent to KLM, including a natural passage in both ways. (3) The two previous results are given for preferential entailments more general than considered in some of the original texts, but they apply also to the original definitions and, for this particular case also, the models can be simplified.",
    "This work analyses main features that should be present in knowledge representation. It suggests a model for representation and a way to implement this model in software. Representation takes care of both low-level sensor information and high-level concepts.",
    "We propose new definitions of (causal) explanation, using structural equations to model counterfactuals. The definition is based on the notion of actual cause, as defined and motivated in a companion paper. Essentially, an explanation is a fact that is not known for certain but, if found to be true, would constitute an actual cause of the fact to be explained, regardless of the agent's initial uncertainty. We show that the definition handles well a number of problematic examples from the literature.",
    "Recently, several approaches to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended logic programs have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate (sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. In this paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge bases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an update policy. We first describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of evolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds on a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances, which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. In more detail, we characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space complexity.",
    "In this thesis I present a virtual laboratory which implements five different models for controlling animats: a rule-based system, a behaviour-based system, a concept-based system, a neural network, and a Braitenberg architecture. Through different experiments, I compare the performance of the models and conclude that there is no \"best\" model, since different models are better for different things in different contexts.   The models I chose, although quite simple, represent different approaches for studying cognition. Using the results as an empirical philosophical aid,   I note that there is no \"best\" approach for studying cognition, since different approaches have all advantages and disadvantages, because they study different aspects of cognition from different contexts. This has implications for current debates on \"proper\" approaches for cognition: all approaches are a bit proper, but none will be \"proper enough\". I draw remarks on the notion of cognition abstracting from all the approaches used to study it, and propose a simple classification for different types of cognition.",
    "This paper deals with the revision of partially ordered beliefs. It proposes a semantic representation of epistemic states by partial pre-orders on interpretations and a syntactic representation by partially ordered belief bases. Two revision operations, the revision stemming from the history of observations and the possibilistic revision, defined when the epistemic state is represented by a total pre-order, are generalized, at a semantic level, to the case of a partial pre-order on interpretations, and at a syntactic level, to the case of a partially ordered belief base. The equivalence between the two representations is shown for the two revision operations.",
    "This is the first in a series of connected papers discussing the problem of a dynamically reconfigurable universal learning neurocomputer that could serve as a computational model for the whole human brain. The whole series is entitled \"The Brain Zero Project. My Brain as a Dynamically Reconfigurable Universal Learning Neurocomputer.\" (For more information visit the website www.brain0.com.) This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology. Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole \"unprogrammed\" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The \"curse of dimensionality\" that plagues purely phenomenological (\"brainless\") cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of insufficiently high dimensionality. A \"partial\" modeler encounters \"Catch 22.\" An attempt to simplify a cognitive problem by artificially reducing its dimensionality makes the problem more difficult.",
    "As a part of our effort for studying the evolution and development of cognition, we present results derived from synthetic experimentations in a virtual laboratory where animats develop koncepts adaptively and ground their meaning through action. We introduce the term \"koncept\" to avoid confusions and ambiguity derived from the wide use of the word \"concept\". We present the models which our animats use for abstracting koncepts from perceptions, plastically adapt koncepts, and associate koncepts with actions. On a more philosophical vein, we suggest that knowledge is a property of a cognitive system, not an element, and therefore observer-dependent.",
    "This paper presents a model for dynamic adjustment of the motivation degree, using a reinforcement learning approach, in an action selection mechanism previously developed by the authors. The learning takes place in the modification of a parameter of the model of combination of internal and external stimuli. Experiments that show the claimed properties are presented, using a VR simulation developed for such purposes. The importance of adaptation by learning in action selection is also discussed.",
    "This article analyses the properties of the Internal Behaviour network, an action selection mechanism previously proposed by the authors, with the aid of a simulation developed for such ends. A brief review of the Internal Behaviour network is followed by the explanation of the implementation of the simulation. Then, experiments are presented and discussed analysing the properties of the action selection in the proposed model.",
    "This paper proposes a model for combination of external and internal stimuli for the action selection in an autonomous agent, based in an action selection mechanism previously proposed by the authors. This combination model includes additive and multiplicative elements, which allows to incorporate new properties, which enhance the action selection. A given parameter a, which is part of the proposed model, allows to regulate the degree of dependence of the observed external behaviour from the internal states of the entity.",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) involves sequential decision making in uncertain environments. The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit of acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an optimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm, or various other methods using macro-actions.   Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal. In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations.",
    "Optimization of decision problems in stochastic environments is usually concerned with maximizing the probability of achieving the goal and minimizing the expected episode length. For interacting agents in time-critical applications, learning of the possibility of scheduling of subtasks (events) or the full task is an additional relevant issue. Besides, there exist highly stochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from episode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of time. The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g., planning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work, formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the duration of events are derived. The emerging Bellman-type equation is a simple extension of Sobel's work (1982). Methods of dynamic programming as well as methods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. Computer demonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle.",
    "Much work has been done on extending the well-founded semantics to general disjunctive logic programs and various approaches have been proposed. However, these semantics are different from each other and no consensus is reached about which semantics is the most intended. In this paper we look at disjunctive well-founded reasoning from different angles. We show that there is an intuitive form of the well-founded reasoning in disjunctive logic programming which can be characterized by slightly modifying some exisitng approaches to defining disjunctive well-founded semantics, including program transformations, argumentation, unfounded sets (and resolution-like procedure). We also provide a bottom-up procedure for this semantics. The significance of our work is not only in clarifying the relationship among different approaches, but also shed some light on what is an intended well-founded semantics for disjunctive logic programs.",
    "We consider the problem of binary classification where one can, for a particular cost, choose not to classify an observation. We present a simple proof for the oracle inequality for the excess risk of structural risk minimizers using a lasso type penalty.",
    "The distance metric plays an important role in nearest neighbor (NN) classification. Usually the Euclidean distance metric is assumed or a Mahalanobis distance metric is optimized to improve the NN performance. In this paper, we study the problem of embedding arbitrary metric spaces into a Euclidean space with the goal to improve the accuracy of the NN classifier. We propose a solution by appealing to the framework of regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and prove a representer-like theorem for NN classification. The embedding function is then determined by solving a semidefinite program which has an interesting connection to the soft-margin linear binary support vector machine classifier. Although the main focus of this paper is to present a general, theoretical framework for metric embedding in a NN setting, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on some benchmark datasets and show that it performs better than the Mahalanobis metric learning algorithm in terms of leave-one-out and generalization errors.",
    "Dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces, hence objects of nonarchimedean geometry. It is known that there exist $p$-adic representation of dendrograms. Completed by a point at infinity, they can be viewed as subtrees of the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the $p$-adic projective line. The implications are that certain moduli spaces known in algebraic geometry are $p$-adic parameter spaces of (families of) dendrograms, and stochastic classification can also be handled within this framework. At the end, we calculate the topology of the hidden part of a dendrogram.",
    "A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh (2004b). This method embeds a dendrogram as a subtree into the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the p-adic numbers, and goes back to Cornelissen et al. (2001) in p-adic geometry. After explaining the definitions, the concept of classifiers is discussed in the context of moduli spaces, and upper bounds for the number of hidden vertices in dendrograms are given.",
    "We present and analyse three online algorithms for learning in discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and compare them with the Baldi-Chauvin Algorithm. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of generalisation error we draw learning curves in simplified situations. The performance for learning drifting concepts of one of the presented algorithms is analysed and compared with the Baldi-Chauvin algorithm in the same situations. A brief discussion about learning and symmetry breaking based on our results is also presented.",
    "In recent years, kernel density estimation has been exploited by computer scientists to model machine learning problems. The kernel density estimation based approaches are of interest due to the low time complexity of either O(n) or O(n*log(n)) for constructing a classifier, where n is the number of sampling instances. Concerning design of kernel density estimators, one essential issue is how fast the pointwise mean square error (MSE) and/or the integrated mean square error (IMSE) diminish as the number of sampling instances increases. In this article, it is shown that with the proposed kernel function it is feasible to make the pointwise MSE of the density estimator converge at O(n^-2/3) regardless of the dimension of the vector space, provided that the probability density function at the point of interest meets certain conditions.",
    "This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such as thousands, of features in regression and classification problems.   There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models.   High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.   We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both chapters.",
    "Simulated annealing is a popular method for approaching the solution of a global optimization problem. Existing results on its performance apply to discrete combinatorial optimization where the optimization variables can assume only a finite set of possible values. We introduce a new general formulation of simulated annealing which allows one to guarantee finite-time performance in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. The results hold universally for any optimization problem on a bounded domain and establish a connection between simulated annealing and up-to-date theory of convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on continuous domains. This work is inspired by the concept of finite-time learning with known accuracy and confidence developed in statistical learning theory.",
    "We present the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP), a stochastic process which assigns probability distributions to infinitely-deep, infinitely-branching trees. We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientific abstracts from several journals. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning--the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures.",
    "We provide self-contained proof of a theorem relating probabilistic coherence of forecasts to their non-domination by rival forecasts with respect to any proper scoring rule. The theorem appears to be new but is closely related to results achieved by other investigators.",
    "Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.",
    "We characterize and study variable importance (VIMP) and pairwise variable associations in binary regression trees. A key component involves the node mean squared error for a quantity we refer to as a maximal subtree. The theory naturally extends from single trees to ensembles of trees and applies to methods like random forests. This is useful because while importance values from random forests are used to screen variables, for example they are used to filter high throughput genomic data in Bioinformatics, very little theory exists about their properties.",
    "This monograph deals with adaptive supervised classification, using tools borrowed from statistical mechanics and information theory, stemming from the PACBayesian approach pioneered by David McAllester and applied to a conception of statistical learning theory forged by Vladimir Vapnik. Using convex analysis on the set of posterior probability measures, we show how to get local measures of the complexity of the classification model involving the relative entropy of posterior distributions with respect to Gibbs posterior measures. We then discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of patterns and labels. Finally we review briefly the construction of Support Vector Machines and show how to derive generalization bounds for them, measuring the complexity either through the number of support vectors or through the value of the transductive or inductive margin.",
    "Dimensionality reduction is a topic of recent interest. In this paper, we present the classification constrained dimensionality reduction (CCDR) algorithm to account for label information. The algorithm can account for multiple classes as well as the semi-supervised setting. We present an out-of-sample expressions for both labeled and unlabeled data. For unlabeled data, we introduce a method of embedding a new point as preprocessing to a classifier. For labeled data, we introduce a method that improves the embedding during the training phase using the out-of-sample extension. We investigate classification performance using the CCDR algorithm on hyper-spectral satellite imagery data. We demonstrate the performance gain for both local and global classifiers and demonstrate a 10% improvement of the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm performance. We present a connection between intrinsic dimension estimation and the optimal embedding dimension obtained using the CCDR algorithm.",
    "Being among the easiest ways to find meaningful structure from discrete data, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related component models have been applied widely. They are simple, computationally fast and scalable, interpretable, and admit nonparametric priors. In the currently popular field of network modeling, relatively little work has taken uncertainty of data seriously in the Bayesian sense, and component models have been introduced to the field only recently, by treating each node as a bag of out-going links. We introduce an alternative, interaction component model for communities (ICMc), where the whole network is a bag of links, stemming from different components. The former finds both disassortative and assortative structure, while the alternative assumes assortativity and finds community-like structures like the earlier methods motivated by physics. With Dirichlet Process priors and an efficient implementation the models are highly scalable, as demonstrated with a social network from the Last.fm web site, with 670,000 nodes and 1.89 million links.",
    "We propose to investigate test statistics for testing homogeneity in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Asymptotic null distributions under null hypothesis are derived, and consistency against fixed and local alternatives is assessed. Finally, experimental evidence of the performance of the proposed approach on both artificial data and a speaker verification task is provided.",
    "When using the K-nearest neighbors method, one often ignores uncertainty in the choice of K. To account for such uncertainty, Holmes and Adams (2002) proposed a Bayesian framework for K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Their Bayesian KNN (BKNN) approach uses a pseudo-likelihood function, and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to draw posterior samples. Holmes and Adams (2002) focused on the performance of BKNN in terms of misclassification error but did not assess its ability to quantify uncertainty. We present some evidence to show that BKNN still significantly underestimates model uncertainty.",
    "Flow cytometry is often used to characterize the malignant cells in leukemia and lymphoma patients, traced to the level of the individual cell. Typically, flow cytometric data analysis is performed through a series of 2-dimensional projections onto the axes of the data set. Through the years, clinicians have determined combinations of different fluorescent markers which generate relatively known expression patterns for specific subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma -- cancers of the hematopoietic system. By only viewing a series of 2-dimensional projections, the high-dimensional nature of the data is rarely exploited. In this paper we present a means of determining a low-dimensional projection which maintains the high-dimensional relationships (i.e. information) between differing oncological data sets. By using machine learning techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just 2 at a time. This provides an aid in diagnosing similar forms of cancer, as well as a means for variable selection in exploratory flow cytometric research. We refer to our method as Information Preserving Component Analysis (IPCA).",
    "A simple and computationally efficient scheme for tree-structured vector quantization is presented. Unlike previous methods, its quantization error depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution, rather than the apparent dimension of the space in which the data happen to lie.",
    "We analyze the performance of a class of manifold-learning algorithms that find their output by minimizing a quadratic form under some normalization constraints. This class consists of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmap, Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE), and Diffusion maps. We present and prove conditions on the manifold that are necessary for the success of the algorithms. Both the finite sample case and the limit case are analyzed. We show that there are simple manifolds in which the necessary conditions are violated, and hence the algorithms cannot recover the underlying manifolds. Finally, we present numerical results that demonstrate our claims.",
    "We present the Procrustes measure, a novel measure based on Procrustes rotation that enables quantitative comparison of the output of manifold-based embedding algorithms (such as LLE (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (Tenenbaum et al, 2000)). The measure also serves as a natural tool when choosing dimension-reduction parameters. We also present two novel dimension-reduction techniques that attempt to minimize the suggested measure, and compare the results of these techniques to the results of existing algorithms. Finally, we suggest a simple iterative method that can be used to improve the output of existing algorithms.",
    "The problem of supervised classification (or discrimination) with functional data is considered, with a special interest on the popular k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. First, relying on a recent result by Cerou and Guyader (2006), we prove the consistency of the k-NN classifier for functional data whose distribution belongs to a broad family of Gaussian processes with triangular covariance functions. Second, on a more practical side, we check the behavior of the k-NN method when compared with a few other functional classifiers. This is carried out through a small simulation study and the analysis of several real functional data sets. While no global \"uniform\" winner emerges from such comparisons, the overall performance of the k-NN method, together with its sound intuitive motivation and relative simplicity, suggests that it could represent a reasonable benchmark for the classification problem with functional data.",
    "We propose a new sparsity-smoothness penalty for high-dimensional generalized additive models. The combination of sparsity and smoothness is crucial for mathematical theory as well as performance for finite-sample data. We present a computationally efficient algorithm, with provable numerical convergence properties, for optimizing the penalized likelihood. Furthermore, we provide oracle results which yield asymptotic optimality of our estimator for high dimensional but sparse additive models. Finally, an adaptive version of our sparsity-smoothness penalized approach yields large additional performance gains.",
    "The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional neighborhood representation.",
    "We construct a framework for studying clustering algorithms, which includes two key ideas: persistence and functoriality. The first encodes the idea that the output of a clustering scheme should carry a multiresolution structure, the second the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme, stability and convergence are established.",
    "We consider principal component analysis (PCA) in decomposable Gaussian graphical models. We exploit the prior information in these models in order to distribute its computation. For this purpose, we reformulate the problem in the sparse inverse covariance (concentration) domain and solve the global eigenvalue problem using a sequence of local eigenvalue problems in each of the cliques of the decomposable graph. We demonstrate the application of our methodology in the context of decentralized anomaly detection in the Abilene backbone network. Based on the topology of the network, we propose an approximate statistical graphical model and distribute the computation of PCA.",
    "Many problems of low-level computer vision and image processing, such as denoising, deconvolution, tomographic reconstruction or super-resolution, can be addressed by maximizing the posterior distribution of a sparse linear model (SLM). We show how higher-order Bayesian decision-making problems, such as optimizing image acquisition in magnetic resonance scanners, can be addressed by querying the SLM posterior covariance, unrelated to the density's mode. We propose a scalable algorithmic framework, with which SLM posteriors over full, high-resolution images can be approximated for the first time, solving a variational optimization problem which is convex iff posterior mode finding is convex. These methods successfully drive the optimization of sampling trajectories for real-world magnetic resonance imaging through Bayesian experimental design, which has not been attempted before. Our methodology provides new insight into similarities and differences between sparse reconstruction and approximate Bayesian inference, and has important implications for compressive sensing of real-world images.",
    "We present a new online boosting algorithm for adapting the weights of a boosted classifier, which yields a closer approximation to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm than previous online boosting algorithms. We also contribute a new way of deriving the online algorithm that ties together previous online boosting work. We assume that the weak hypotheses were selected beforehand, and only their weights are updated during online boosting. The update rule is derived by minimizing AdaBoost's loss when viewed in an incremental form. The equations show that optimization is computationally expensive. However, a fast online approximation is possible. We compare approximation error to batch AdaBoost on synthetic datasets and generalization error on face datasets and the MNIST dataset.",
    "In this report, we derive a non-negative series expansion for the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between two probability distributions. This series expansion is shown to be useful for numerical calculations of the JSD, when the probability distributions are nearly equal, and for which, consequently, small numerical errors dominate evaluation.",
    "We consider the problem of jointly estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary valued Markov Random Fields, in contrast to earlier work that focus on one of the two problems. We formulate the problem as a maximization of $\\ell_1$-regularized surrogate likelihood that allows us to find a sparse solution. Our optimization technique efficiently incorporates the cutting-plane algorithm in order to obtain a tighter outer bound on the marginal polytope, which results in improvement of both parameter estimates and approximation to marginals. On synthetic data, we compare our algorithm on the two estimation tasks to the other existing methods. We analyze the method in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of dimensions $p$ is allowed to grow with the number of observations $n$. The rate of convergence of the estimate is demonstrated to depend explicitly on the sparsity of the underlying graph.",
    "The most direct way to express arbitrary dependencies in datasets is to estimate the joint distribution and to apply afterwards the argmax-function to obtain the mode of the corresponding conditional distribution. This method is in practice difficult, because it requires a global optimization of a complicated function, the joint distribution by fixed input variables. This article proposes a method for finding global maxima if the joint distribution is modeled by a kernel density estimation. Some experiments show advantages and shortcomings of the resulting regression method in comparison to the standard Nadaraya-Watson regression technique, which approximates the optimum by the expectation value.",
    "We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from small-sample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. Specifically, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator.",
    "This paper examines from an experimental perspective random forests, the increasingly used statistical method for classification and regression problems introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001. It first aims at confirming, known but sparse, advice for using random forests and at proposing some complementary remarks for both standard problems as well as high dimensional ones for which the number of variables hugely exceeds the sample size. But the main contribution of this paper is twofold: to provide some insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and in addition, to propose to investigate two classical issues of variable selection. The first one is to find important variables for interpretation and the second one is more restrictive and try to design a good prediction model. The strategy involves a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy.",
    "Min-cut clustering, based on minimizing one of two heuristic cost-functions proposed by Shi and Malik, has spawned tremendous research, both analytic and algorithmic, in the graph partitioning and image segmentation communities over the last decade. It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings. Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the location of random walkers on the graph. For graphs generated from a stochastic algorithm designed to model community structure, the optimal information theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are shown to be the same with high probability.",
    "Autoencoder neural network is implemented to estimate the missing data. Genetic algorithm is implemented for network optimization and estimating the missing data. Missing data is treated as Missing At Random mechanism by implementing maximum likelihood algorithm. The network performance is determined by calculating the mean square error of the network prediction. The network is further optimized by implementing Decision Forest. The impact of missing data is then investigated and decision forrests are found to improve the results.",
    "We obtain an index of the complexity of a random sequence by allowing the role of the measure in classical probability theory to be played by a function we call the generating mechanism. Typically, this generating mechanism will be a finite automata. We generate a set of biased sequences by applying a finite state automata with a specified number, $m$, of states to the set of all binary sequences. Thus we can index the complexity of our random sequence by the number of states of the automata. We detail optimal algorithms to predict sequences generated in this way.",
    "There has been an explosion of interest in statistical models for analyzing network data, and considerable interest in the class of exponential random graph (ERG) models, especially in connection with difficulties in computing maximum likelihood estimates. The issues associated with these difficulties relate to the broader structure of discrete exponential families. This paper re-examines the issues in two parts. First we consider the closure of $k$-dimensional exponential families of distribution with discrete base measure and polyhedral convex support $\\mathrm{P}$. We show that the normal fan of $\\mathrm{P}$ is a geometric object that plays a fundamental role in deriving the statistical and geometric properties of the corresponding extended exponential families. We discuss its relevance to maximum likelihood estimation, both from a theoretical and computational standpoint. Second, we apply our results to the analysis of ERG models. In particular, by means of a detailed example, we provide some characterization of the properties of ERG models, and, in particular, of certain behaviors of ERG models known as degeneracy.",
    "This article introduces both a new algorithm for reconstructing epsilon-machines from data, as well as the decisional states. These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the \"emerging\" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in images.",
    "The runtime for Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to compute the fit is quadratic in the number of examples. However, the necessity of obtaining sensitivity measures as degrees of freedom for model selection or confidence intervals for more detailed analysis requires cubic runtime, and thus constitutes a computational bottleneck in real-world data analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for KPLS which not only computes (a) the fit, but also (b) its approximate degrees of freedom and (c) error bars in quadratic runtime. The algorithm exploits a close connection between Kernel PLS and the Lanczos algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, and uses this approximation to compute the trace of powers of the kernel matrix in quadratic runtime.",
    "We present the first tree-based regressor whose convergence rate depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data, namely its Assouad dimension. The regressor uses the RPtree partitioning procedure, a simple randomized variant of k-d trees.",
    "Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula--or \"nonparanormal\"--for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.",
    "Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number of variables and n: the number of observations). However, modern datasets including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than observations (p>>n). In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. The key idea is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead of estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the causal mechanism. We present experiments with artificial data and real-world gene expression data to evaluate the method.",
    "We consider the empirical risk minimization problem for linear supervised learning, with regularization by structured sparsity-inducing norms. These are defined as sums of Euclidean norms on certain subsets of variables, extending the usual $\\ell_1$-norm and the group $\\ell_1$-norm by allowing the subsets to overlap. This leads to a specific set of allowed nonzero patterns for the solutions of such problems. We first explore the relationship between the groups defining the norm and the resulting nonzero patterns, providing both forward and backward algorithms to go back and forth from groups to patterns. This allows the design of norms adapted to specific prior knowledge expressed in terms of nonzero patterns. We also present an efficient active set algorithm, and analyze the consistency of variable selection for least-squares linear regression in low and high-dimensional settings.",
    "We prove that the criterion for Markov equivalence provided by Zhao et al. (2005) may involve a set of features of a graph that is exponential in the number of vertices.",
    "We present a new boosting algorithm, motivated by the large margins theory for boosting. We give experimental evidence that the new algorithm is significantly more robust against label noise than existing boosting algorithm.",
    "Variable selection for high-dimensional linear models has received a lot of attention lately, mostly in the context of l1-regularization. Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation. The predictive power is maintained at least at the same level as the original tree ensemble. A key feature of the method is that, once a tree ensemble is fitted, no further tuning parameter needs to be selected. The empirical performance is demonstrated on a wide array of datasets.",
    "Most accurate predictions are typically obtained by learning machines with complex feature spaces (as e.g. induced by kernels). Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations.",
    "Selecting important features in non-linear or kernel spaces is a difficult challenge in both classification and regression problems. When many of the features are irrelevant, kernel methods such as the support vector machine and kernel ridge regression can sometimes perform poorly. We propose weighting the features within a kernel with a sparse set of weights that are estimated in conjunction with the original classification or regression problem. The iterative algorithm, KNIFE, alternates between finding the coefficients of the original problem and finding the feature weights through kernel linearization. In addition, a slight modification of KNIFE yields an efficient algorithm for finding feature regularization paths, or the paths of each feature's weight. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of KNIFE for both kernel regression and support vector machines with a variety of kernels. Feature path realizations also reveal important non-linear correlations among features that prove useful in determining a subset of significant variables. Results on vowel recognition data, Parkinson's disease data, and microarray data are also given.",
    "We introduce a new Bayesian model for hierarchical clustering based on a prior over trees called Kingman's coalescent. We develop novel greedy and sequential Monte Carlo inferences which operate in a bottom-up agglomerative fashion. We show experimentally the superiority of our algorithms over others, and demonstrate our approach in document clustering and phylolinguistics.",
    "We describe a new method for visualizing topics, the distributions over terms that are automatically extracted from large text corpora using latent variable models. Our method finds significant $n$-grams related to a topic, which are then used to help understand and interpret the underlying distribution. Compared with the usual visualization, which simply lists the most probable topical terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better intuitive impression for what a topic is \"about.\" Our approach is based on a language model of arbitrary length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show that this method outperforms the more standard use of $\\chi^2$ and likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and news articles.",
    "Network models have been popular for modeling and representing complex relationships and dependencies between observed variables. When data comes from a dynamic stochastic process, a single static network model cannot adequately capture transient dependencies, such as, gene regulatory dependencies throughout a developmental cycle of an organism. Kolar et al (2010b) proposed a method based on kernel-smoothing l1-penalized logistic regression for estimating time-varying networks from nodal observations collected from a time-series of observational data. In this paper, we establish conditions under which the proposed method consistently recovers the structure of a time-varying network. This work complements previous empirical findings by providing sound theoretical guarantees for the proposed estimation procedure. For completeness, we include numerical simulations in the paper.",
    "We give improved constants for data dependent and variance sensitive confidence bounds, called empirical Bernstein bounds, and extend these inequalities to hold uniformly over classes of functionswhose growth function is polynomial in the sample size n. The bounds lead us to consider sample variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}. We show some experimental results, which confirm the theory. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our results to sample compression schemes.",
    "We discuss here the mean-field theory for a cellular automata model of meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming information using various types, or different versions of machine learning algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials. The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents.",
    "We investigate the role of the initialization for the stability of the k-means clustering algorithm. As opposed to other papers, we consider the actual k-means algorithm and do not ignore its property of getting stuck in local optima. We are interested in the actual clustering, not only in the costs of the solution. We analyze when different initializations lead to the same local optimum, and when they lead to different local optima. This enables us to prove that it is reasonable to select the number of clusters based on stability scores.",
    "We introduce a new nearest-prototype classifier, the prototype vector machine (PVM). It arises from a combinatorial optimization problem which we cast as a variant of the set cover problem. We propose two algorithms for approximating its solution. The PVM selects a relatively small number of representative points which can then be used for classification. It contains 1-NN as a special case. The method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which the data are not embedded in an underlying feature space or in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable. Indeed, we demonstrate on the much studied ZIP code data how the PVM can reap the benefits of a problem-specific metric. In this example, the PVM outperforms the highly successful 1-NN with tangent distance, and does so retaining fewer than half of the data points. This example highlights the strengths of the PVM in yielding a low-error, highly interpretable model. Additionally, we apply the PVM to a protein classification problem in which a kernel-based distance is used.",

    "We propose an extension of the concept of Expected Improvement criterion commonly used in Kriging based optimization. We extend it for more complex Kriging models, e.g. models using derivatives. The target field of application are CFD problems, where objective function are extremely expensive to evaluate, but the theory can be also used in other fields.",
    "bnlearn is an R package which includes several algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks with either discrete or continuous variables. Both constraint-based and score-based algorithms are implemented, and can use the functionality provided by the snow package to improve their performance via parallel computing. Several network scores and conditional independence algorithms are available for both the learning algorithms and independent use. Advanced plotting options are provided by the Rgraphviz package.",
    "We present in this work a new family of kernels to compare positive measures on arbitrary spaces $\\Xcal$ endowed with a positive kernel $\\kappa$, which translates naturally into kernels between histograms or clouds of points. We first cover the case where $\\Xcal$ is Euclidian, and focus on kernels which take into account the variance matrix of the mixture of two measures to compute their similarity. The kernels we define are semigroup kernels in the sense that they only use the sum of two measures to compare them, and spectral in the sense that they only use the eigenspectrum of the variance matrix of this mixture. We show that such a family of kernels has close bonds with the laplace transforms of nonnegative-valued functions defined on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and we present some closed formulas that can be derived as special cases of such integral expressions. By focusing further on functions which are invariant to the addition of a null eigenvalue to the spectrum of the variance matrix, we can define kernels between atomic measures on arbitrary spaces $\\Xcal$ endowed with a kernel $\\kappa$ by using directly the eigenvalues of the centered Gram matrix of the joined support of the compared measures. We provide explicit formulas suited for applications and present preliminary experiments to illustrate the interest of the approach.",
    "We present an extension of sparse PCA, or sparse dictionary learning, where the sparsity patterns of all dictionary elements are structured and constrained to belong to a prespecified set of shapes. This \\emph{structured sparse PCA} is based on a structured regularization recently introduced by [1]. While classical sparse priors only deal with \\textit{cardinality}, the regularization we use encodes higher-order information about the data. We propose an efficient and simple optimization procedure to solve this problem. Experiments with two practical tasks, face recognition and the study of the dynamics of a protein complex, demonstrate the benefits of the proposed structured approach over unstructured approaches.",
    "We describe a method for inferring linear causal relations among multi-dimensional variables. The idea is to use an asymmetry between the distributions of cause and effect that occurs if both the covariance matrix of the cause and the structure matrix mapping cause to the effect are independently chosen. The method works for both stochastic and deterministic causal relations, provided that the dimensionality is sufficiently high (in some experiments, 5 was enough). It is applicable to Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data.",
    "This paper proposes an original approach to cluster multi-component data sets, including an estimation of the number of clusters. From the construction of a minimal spanning tree with Prim's algorithm, and the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according to a Poisson distribution, the number of clusters is estimated by thresholding the Prim's trajectory. The corresponding cluster centroids are then computed in order to initialize the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, also known as $K$-means, which allows to circumvent initialization problems. Some results are derived for evaluating the false positive rate of our cluster detection algorithm, with the help of approximations relevant in Euclidean spaces. Metrics used for measuring similarity between multi-dimensional data points are based on symmetrical divergences. The use of these informational divergences together with the proposed method leads to better results, compared to other clustering methods for the problem of astrophysical data processing. Some applications of this method in the multi/hyper-spectral imagery domain to a satellite view of Paris and to an image of the Mars planet are also presented. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of divergences in our problem, the method with informational divergence as similarity measure is compared with the same method using classical metrics. In the astrophysics application, we also compare the method with the spectral clustering algorithms.",
    "We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new method of nonparametric regression that accommodates continuous and categorical inputs, and responses that can be modeled by a generalized linear model. We prove conditions for the asymptotic unbiasedness of the DP-GLM regression mean function estimate. We also give examples for when those conditions hold, including models for compactly supported continuous distributions and a model with continuous covariates and categorical response. We empirically analyze the properties of the DP-GLM and why it provides better results than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We evaluate DP-GLM on several data sets, comparing it to modern methods of nonparametric regression like CART, Bayesian trees and Gaussian processes. Compared to existing techniques, the DP-GLM provides a single model (and corresponding inference algorithms) that performs well in many regression settings.",
    "In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step. Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.",
    "Many inference problems involving questions of optimality ask for the maximum or the minimum of a finite set of unknown quantities. This technical report derives the first two posterior moments of the maximum of two correlated Gaussian variables and the first two posterior moments of the two generating variables (corresponding to Gaussian approximations minimizing relative entropy). It is shown how this can be used to build a heuristic approximation to the maximum relationship over a finite set of Gaussian variables, allowing approximate inference by Expectation Propagation on such quantities.",
    "This paper reviews the functional aspects of statistical learning theory. The main point under consideration is the nature of the hypothesis set when no prior information is available but data. Within this framework we first discuss about the hypothesis set: it is a vectorial space, it is a set of pointwise defined functions, and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous mapping. Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets. Then it is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a generalized reproducing set. Therefore, thanks to a general \"representer theorem\", the solution of the learning problem is still a linear combination of a kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given. To illustrate this framework some examples of such reproducing sets and kernels are given.",
    "The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle states that the optimal model for a given data set is that which compresses it best. Due to practial limitations the model can be restricted to a class such as linear regression models, which we address in this study. As in other formulations such as the LASSO and forward step-wise regression we are interested in sparsifying the feature set while preserving generalization ability. We derive a well-principled set of codes for both parameters and error residuals along with smooth approximations to lengths of these codes as to allow gradient descent optimization of description length, and go on to show that sparsification and feature selection using our approach is faster than the LASSO on several datasets from the UCI and StatLib repositories, with favorable generalization accuracy, while being fully automatic, requiring neither cross-validation nor tuning of regularization hyper-parameters, allowing even for a nonlinear expansion of the feature set followed by sparsification.",
    "We propose a method to infer causal structures containing both discrete and continuous variables. The idea is to select causal hypotheses for which the conditional density of every variable, given its causes, becomes smooth. We define a family of smooth densities and conditional densities by second order exponential models, i.e., by maximizing conditional entropy subject to first and second statistical moments. If some of the variables take only values in proper subsets of R^n, these conditionals can induce different families of joint distributions even for Markov-equivalent graphs.   We consider the case of one binary and one real-valued variable where the method can distinguish between cause and effect. Using this example, we describe that sometimes a causal hypothesis must be rejected because P(effect|cause) and P(cause) share algorithmic information (which is untypical if they are chosen independently). This way, our method is in the same spirit as faithfulness-based causal inference because it also rejects non-generic mutual adjustments among DAG-parameters.",
    "Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive noise models to these cases. We prove that whenever the joint distribution $\\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g. $Y=f(X)+N, N \\independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model $X=g(Y)+\\tilde N, \\tilde N \\independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of discrete variables. In an extensive experimental study we show that this algorithm works both on synthetic and real data sets.",
    "Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying driving forces from quickly varying nonstationary time series. We show here that it is possible for SFA to detect a component which is even slower than the driving force itself (e.g. the envelope of a modulated sine wave). It is shown that it depends on circumstances like the embedding dimension, the time series predictability, or the base frequency, whether the driving force itself or a slower subcomponent is detected. We observe a phase transition from one regime to the other and it is the purpose of this work to quantify the influence of various parameters on this phase transition. We conclude that what is percieved as slow by SFA varies and that a more or less fast switching from one regime to the other occurs, perhaps showing some similarity to human perception.",
    "Recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output. We show experimental results with synthetic and real data, in particular, we show results in pollution prediction, school exams score prediction and gene expression data.",
    "This survey is an introduction to positive definite kernels and the set of methods they have inspired in the machine learning literature, namely kernel methods. We first discuss some properties of positive definite kernels as well as reproducing kernel Hibert spaces, the natural extension of the set of functions $\\{k(x,\\cdot),x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\}$ associated with a kernel $k$ defined on a space $\\mathcal{X}$. We discuss at length the construction of kernel functions that take advantage of well-known statistical models. We provide an overview of numerous data-analysis methods which take advantage of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the idea of combining several kernels to improve the performance on certain tasks. We also provide a short cookbook of different kernels which are particularly useful for certain data-types such as images, graphs or speech segments.",
    "This article addresses the modeling of reverberant recording environments in the context of under-determined convolutive blind source separation. We model the contribution of each source to all mixture channels in the time-frequency domain as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable whose covariance encodes the spatial characteristics of the source. We then consider four specific covariance models, including a full-rank unconstrained model. We derive a family of iterative expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of each model and propose suitable procedures to initialize the parameters and to align the order of the estimated sources across all frequency bins based on their estimated directions of arrival (DOA). Experimental results over reverberant synthetic mixtures and live recordings of speech data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
    "In this paper, we consider the problem of \"hyper-sparse aggregation\". Namely, given a dictionary $F = \\{f_1, ..., f_M \\}$ of functions, we look for an optimal aggregation algorithm that writes $\\tilde f = \\sum_{j=1}^M \\theta_j f_j$ with as many zero coefficients $\\theta_j$ as possible. This problem is of particular interest when $F$ contains many irrelevant functions that should not appear in $\\tilde{f}$. We provide an exact oracle inequality for $\\tilde f$, where only two coefficients are non-zero, that entails $\\tilde f$ to be an optimal aggregation algorithm. Since selectors are suboptimal aggregation procedures, this proves that 2 is the minimal number of elements of $F$ required for the construction of an optimal aggregation procedures in every situations. A simulated example of this algorithm is proposed on a dictionary obtained using LARS, for the problem of selection of the regularization parameter of the LASSO. We also give an example of use of aggregation to achieve minimax adaptation over anisotropic Besov spaces, which was not previously known in minimax theory (in regression on a random design).",
    "We extend multi-way, multivariate ANOVA-type analysis to cases where one covariate is the view, with features of each view coming from different, high-dimensional domains. The different views are assumed to be connected by having paired samples; this is a common setup in recent bioinformatics experiments, of which we analyze metabolite profiles in different conditions (disease vs. control and treatment vs. untreated) in different tissues (views). We introduce a multi-way latent variable model for this new task, by extending the generative model of Bayesian canonical correlation analysis (CCA) both to take multi-way covariate information into account as population priors, and by reducing the dimensionality by an integrated factor analysis that assumes the metabolites to come in correlated groups.",
    "Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence (2009) recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series.",
    "We study losses for binary classification and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and ``classification calibrated'' losses. We also consider the question of the ``best'' surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of ``best'' and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of ``surrogate tuning''. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassification noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassification noise.",
    "We provide yet another proof of the existence of calibrated forecasters; it has two merits. First, it is valid for an arbitrary finite number of outcomes. Second, it is short and simple and it follows from a direct application of Blackwell's approachability theorem to carefully chosen vector-valued payoff function and convex target set. Our proof captures the essence of existing proofs based on approachability (e.g., the proof by Foster, 1999 in case of binary outcomes) and highlights the intrinsic connection between approachability and calibration.",
    "Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets.",
    "We study graph estimation and density estimation in high dimensions, using a family of density estimators based on forest structured undirected graphical models. For density estimation, we do not assume the true distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal's algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes. We prove that finding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we then select a forest using data splitting, and prove bounds on excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure. Experiments with simulated data and microarray data indicate that the methods are a practical alternative to Gaussian graphical models.",
    "We assume data independently sampled from a mixture distribution on the unit ball of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with K+1 components: the first component is a uniform distribution on that ball representing outliers and the other K components are uniform distributions along K d-dimensional linear subspaces restricted to that ball. We study both the simultaneous recovery of all K underlying subspaces and the recovery of the best l0 subspace (i.e., with largest number of points) by minimizing the lp-averaged distances of data points from d-dimensional subspaces of the D-dimensional space. Unlike other lp minimization problems, this minimization is non-convex for all p>0 and thus requires different methods for its analysis. We show that if 0<p <= 1, then both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace can be precisely recovered by lp minimization with overwhelming probability. This result extends to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform distribution in a strip around them) and near recovery with an error proportional to the noise level. On the other hand, if K>1 and p>1, then we show that both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace cannot be recovered and even nearly recovered. Further relaxations are also discussed. We use the results of this paper for partially justifying recent effective algorithms for modeling data by mixtures of multiple subspaces as well as for discussing the effect of using variants of lp minimizations in RANSAC-type strategies for single subspace recovery.",
    "Independent component analysis (ICA) aims at decomposing an observed random vector into statistically independent variables. Deflation-based implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper. This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an alternative ICA-based technique.",
    "Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms.",
    "We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We derive an approximate maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on variational methods to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction problems motivate this research: we use the fitted model to predict response values for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings predicted from reviews, and the political tone of amendments in the U.S. Senate based on the amendment text. We illustrate the benefits of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression.",
    "We study the problem of allocating stocks to dark pools. We propose and analyze an optimal approach for allocations, if continuous-valued allocations are allowed. We also propose a modification for the case when only integer-valued allocations are possible. We extend the previous work on this problem to adversarial scenarios, while also improving on their results in the iid setup. The resulting algorithms are efficient, and perform well in simulations under stochastic and adversarial inputs.",
    "We propose a novel algorithm for greedy forward feature selection for regularized least-squares (RLS) regression and classification, also known as the least-squares support vector machine or ridge regression. The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm and its ability to find good quality feature sets.",
    "The class of Schoenberg transformations, embedding Euclidean distances into higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, is presented, and derived from theorems on positive definite and conditionally negative definite matrices. Original results on the arc lengths, angles and curvature of the transformations are proposed, and visualized on artificial data sets by classical multidimensional scaling. A simple distance-based discriminant algorithm illustrates the theory, intimately connected to the Gaussian kernels of Machine Learning.",
    "The present contribution suggests the use of a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm as a visualization tool for manifold-valued elements. A visualization tool of this kind is useful in signal processing and machine learning whenever learning/adaptation algorithms insist on high-dimensional parameter manifolds.",
    "In this paper we formulate in general terms an approach to prove strong consistency of the Empirical Risk Minimisation inductive principle applied to the prototype or distance based clustering. This approach was motivated by the Divisive Information-Theoretic Feature Clustering model in probabilistic space with Kullback-Leibler divergence which may be regarded as a special case within the Clustering Minimisation framework. Also, we propose clustering regularization restricting creation of additional clusters which are not significant or are not essentially different comparing with existing clusters.",
    "In this paper we consider sparse and identifiable linear latent variable (factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of multivariate data. We propose a computationally efficient method for joint parameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component delta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and bench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison. Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d. linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM (Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the temporal and/or spatial data. The source code and scripts are available from http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/slim/.",
    "We define a class of Euclidean distances on weighted graphs, enabling to perform thermodynamic soft graph clustering. The class can be constructed form the \"raw coordinates\" encountered in spectral clustering, and can be extended by means of higher-dimensional embeddings (Schoenberg transformations). Geographical flow data, properly conditioned, illustrate the procedure as well as visualization aspects.",
    "A popular method for selecting the number of clusters is based on stability arguments: one chooses the number of clusters such that the corresponding clustering results are \"most stable\". In recent years, a series of papers has analyzed the behavior of this method from a theoretical point of view. However, the results are very technical and difficult to interpret for non-experts. In this paper we give a high-level overview about the existing literature on clustering stability. In addition to presenting the results in a slightly informal but accessible way, we relate them to each other and discuss their different implications.",
    "Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in $\\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space. The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate the approach with applications.",
    "Supervised linear feature extraction can be achieved by fitting a reduced rank multivariate model. This paper studies rank penalized and rank constrained vector generalized linear models. From the perspective of thresholding rules, we build a framework for fitting singular value penalized models and use it for feature extraction. Through solving the rank constraint form of the problem, we propose progressive feature space reduction for fast computation in high dimensions with little performance loss. A novel projective cross-validation is proposed for parameter tuning in such nonconvex setups. Real data applications are given to show the power of the methodology in supervised dimension reduction and feature extraction.",
    "Support vector machines (SVMs) are special kernel based methods and belong to the most successful learning methods since more than a decade. SVMs can informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems. During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired, such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest.   In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent and statistically robust SMVs for additive models. Examples are quantile regression based on the pinball loss function, regression based on the epsilon-insensitive loss function, and classification based on the hinge loss function.",
    "In the last few years, many different performance measures have been introduced to overcome the weakness of the most natural metric, the Accuracy. Among them, Matthews Correlation Coefficient has recently gained popularity among researchers not only in machine learning but also in several application fields such as bioinformatics. Nonetheless, further novel functions are being proposed in literature. We show that Confusion Entropy, a recently introduced classifier performance measure for multi-class problems, has a strong (monotone) relation with the multi-class generalization of a classical metric, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Computational evidence in support of the claim is provided, together with an outline of the theoretical explanation.",
    "We propose a simple kernel based nearest neighbor approach for handwritten digit classification. The \"distance\" here is actually a kernel defining the similarity between two images. We carefully study the effects of different number of neighbors and weight schemes and report the results. With only a few nearest neighbors (or most similar images) to vote, the test set error rate on MNIST database could reach about 1.5%-2.0%, which is very close to many advanced models.",
    "Kernel Induced Random Survival Forests (KIRSF) is a statistical learning algorithm which aims to improve prediction accuracy for survival data. As in Random Survival Forests (RSF), Cumulative Hazard Function is predicted for each individual in the test set. Prediction error is estimated using Harrell's concordance index (C index) [Harrell et al. (1982)]. The C-index can be interpreted as a misclassification probability and does not depend on a single fixed time for evaluation. The C-index also specifically accounts for censoring. By utilizing kernel functions, KIRSF achieves better results than RSF in many situations. In this report, we show how to incorporate kernel functions into RSF. We test the performance of KIRSF and compare our method to RSF. We find that the KIRSF's performance is better than RSF in many occasions.",
    "Since learning is typically very slow in Boltzmann machines, there is a need to restrict connections within hidden layers. However, the resulting states of hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies. Based on this observation, we propose using $l_1/l_2$ regularization upon the activation possibilities of hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the loacal dependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden units of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden units within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus, the $l_1/l_2$ regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the hidden unit levels. We call RBMs trained with the regularizer \\emph{sparse group} RBMs. The proposed sparse group RBMs are applied to three tasks: modeling patches of natural images, modeling handwritten digits and pretaining a deep networks for a classification task. Furthermore, we illustrate the regularizer can also be applied to deep Boltzmann machines, which lead to sparse group deep Boltzmann machines. When adapted to the MNIST data set, a two-layer sparse group Boltzmann machine achieves an error rate of $0.84\\%$, which is, to our knowledge, the best published result on the permutation-invariant version of the MNIST task.",
    "We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting. Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design matrix complicate the analysis. A clearer and simpler picture emerges by studying the Normal means model. This model, often used in the field of statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying complex procedures.",
    "Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper efficient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the L1-norm. Our method is efficient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: first, we consider fixed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally organize in a prespecified arborescent structure, leading to a better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.",
    "We present surrogate regret bounds for arbitrary surrogate losses in the context of binary classification with label-dependent costs. Such bounds relate a classifier's risk, assessed with respect to a surrogate loss, to its cost-sensitive classification risk. Two approaches to surrogate regret bounds are developed. The first is a direct generalization of Bartlett et al. [2006], who focus on margin-based losses and cost-insensitive classification, while the second adopts the framework of Steinwart [2007] based on calibration functions. Nontrivial surrogate regret bounds are shown to exist precisely when the surrogate loss satisfies a \"calibration\" condition that is easily verified for many common losses. We apply this theory to the class of uneven margin losses, and characterize when these losses are properly calibrated. The uneven hinge, squared error, exponential, and sigmoid losses are then treated in detail.",
    "Finding sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem in signal processing and statistics which has become a subject of interest in recent years. In general, these systems have infinitely many solutions. However, it may be shown that sufficiently sparse solutions may be identified uniquely. In other words, the corresponding linear transformation will be invertible if we restrict its domain to sufficiently sparse vectors. This property may be used, for example, to solve the underdetermined Blind Source Separation (BSS) problem, or to find sparse representation of a signal in an `overcomplete' dictionary of primitive elements (i.e., the so-called atomic decomposition). The main drawback of current methods of finding sparse solutions is their computational complexity. In this paper, we will show that by detecting `active' components of the (potential) solution, i.e., those components having a considerable value, a framework for fast solution of the problem may be devised. The idea leads to a family of algorithms, called `Iterative Detection-Estimation (IDE)', which converge to the solution by successive detection and estimation of its active part. Comparing the performance of IDE(s) with one of the most successful method to date, which is based on Linear Programming (LP), an improvement in speed of about two to three orders of magnitude is observed.",
    "Modeling data with linear combinations of a few elements from a learned dictionary has been the focus of much recent research in machine learning, neuroscience and signal processing. For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations.",
    "A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation without likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model.",
    "In nonparametric classification and regression problems, regularized kernel methods, in particular support vector machines, attract much attention in theoretical and in applied statistics. In an abstract sense, regularized kernel methods (simply called SVMs here) can be seen as regularized M-estimators for a parameter in a (typically infinite dimensional) reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For smooth loss functions, it is shown that the difference between the estimator, i.e.\\ the empirical SVM, and the theoretical SVM is asymptotically normal with rate $\\sqrt{n}$. That is, the standardized difference converges weakly to a Gaussian process in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As common in real applications, the choice of the regularization parameter may depend on the data. The proof is done by an application of the functional delta-method and by showing that the SVM-functional is suitably Hadamard-differentiable.",
    "We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero components of this vector can be \"relaxed\" by regularizing the squared error with a convex penalty function like the $\\ell_1$ norm. However, in many applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\\ell_1$ norm and is flexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso method and other related methods.",
    "We consider the problem of learning a binary classifier from a training set of positive and unlabeled examples, both in the inductive and in the transductive setting. This problem, often referred to as \\emph{PU learning}, differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking, when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We propose a conceptually simple method, akin to bagging, to approach both inductive and transductive PU learning problems, by converting them into series of supervised binary classification problems discriminating the known positive examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of the method on simulated and real data, where it performs at least as well as existing methods while being faster.",
    "Despite the recent progress towards efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL), the structured output case remains an open research front. Current approaches involve repeatedly solving a batch learning problem, which makes them inadequate for large scale scenarios. We propose a new family of online proximal algorithms for MKL (as well as for group-lasso and variants thereof), which overcomes that drawback. We show regret, convergence, and generalization bounds for the proposed method. Experiments on handwriting recognition and dependency parsing testify for the successfulness of the approach.",
    "The group lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the group level. Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods. We also extend the SLS algorithm to the sparse group lasso problem via the Signed Single Line Search (SSLS) algorithm, and give theoretical results to support both algorithms.",
    "We have developed an efficient algorithm for the maximum likelihood joint tracking and association problem in a strong clutter for GMTI data. By using an iterative procedure of the dynamic logic process \"from vague-to-crisp,\" the new tracker overcomes combinatorial complexity of tracking in highly-cluttered scenarios and results in a significant improvement in signal-to-clutter ratio.",
    "A density ratio is defined by the ratio of two probability densities. We study the inference problem of density ratios and apply a semi-parametric density-ratio estimator to the two-sample homogeneity test. In the proposed test procedure, the f-divergence between two probability densities is estimated using a density-ratio estimator. The f-divergence estimator is then exploited for the two-sample homogeneity test. We derive the optimal estimator of f-divergence in the sense of the asymptotic variance, and then investigate the relation between the proposed test procedure and the existing score test based on empirical likelihood estimator. Through numerical studies, we illustrate the adequacy of the asymptotic theory for finite-sample inference.",
    "In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for empirical risk minimizers. In the general setting, we prove sanity-check bounds in the spirit of \\cite{KR99} \\textquotedblleft\\textit{bounds showing that the worst-case error of this estimate is not much worse that of training error estimate} \\textquotedblright . General loss functions and class of predictors with finite VC-dimension are considered. We closely follow the formalism introduced by \\cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$% -fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\\upsilon$-out cross-validation.   In particular, we focus on proving the consistency of the various cross-validation procedures. We point out the interest of each cross-validation procedure in terms of rate of convergence. An estimation curve with transition phases depending on the cross-validation procedure and not only on the percentage of observations in the test sample gives a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation. An interesting consequence is that the size of the test sample is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure.",
    "The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of the data. This paper examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation. Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are \\textit{not} independent of the design matrix.   More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under a sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for the sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary conditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to results for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal to noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data.   Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model selection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with properly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the Lasso is robust to the Poisson-like heteroscedastic noise.",
    "Often we wish to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields.",
    "In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for stable predictors in the context of risk assessment. The notion of stability has been first introduced by \\cite{DEWA79} and extended by \\cite{KEA95}, \\cite{BE01} and \\cite{KUNIY02} to characterize class of predictors with infinite VC dimension. In particular, this covers $k$-nearest neighbors rules, bayesian algorithm (\\cite{KEA95}), boosting,... General loss functions and class of predictors are considered. We use the formalism introduced by \\cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$-fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\\upsilon$-out cross-validation.   In particular, we give a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation, depending on the stability of the class of predictors. In the special case of uniform stability, an interesting consequence is that the number of elements in the test set is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure. In this special case, the particular interest of leave-one-out cross-validation is emphasized.",
    "In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for subagged estimators, both for classification and regressor. General loss functions and class of predictors with both finite and infinite VC-dimension are considered. We slightly generalize the formalism introduced by \\cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$-fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\\upsilon$-out cross-validation.   \\bigskip   \\noindent An interesting consequence is that the probability upper bound is bounded by the minimum of a Hoeffding-type bound and a Vapnik-type bounds, and thus is smaller than 1 even for small learning set. Finally, we give a simple rule on how to subbag the predictor. \\bigskip",
    "The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem. Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated.",
    "Translating potential disease biomarkers between multi-species 'omics' experiments is a new direction in biomedical research. The existing methods are limited to simple experimental setups such as basic healthy-diseased comparisons. Most of these methods also require an a priori matching of the variables (e.g., genes or metabolites) between the species. However, many experiments have a complicated multi-way experimental design often involving irregularly-sampled time-series measurements, and for instance metabolites do not always have known matchings between organisms. We introduce a Bayesian modelling framework for translating between multiple species the results from 'omics' experiments having a complex multi-way, time-series experimental design. The underlying assumption is that the unknown matching can be inferred from the response of the variables to multiple covariates including time.",
    "We propose a novel algorithm to solve the expectation propagation relaxation of Bayesian inference for continuous-variable graphical models. In contrast to most previous algorithms, our method is provably convergent. By marrying convergent EP ideas from (Opper&Winther 05) with covariance decoupling techniques (Wipf&Nagarajan 08, Nickisch&Seeger 09), it runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the most commonly used EP solver.",
    "We study the problem of estimating a temporally varying coefficient and varying structure (VCVS) graphical model underlying nonstationary time series data, such as social states of interacting individuals or microarray expression profiles of gene networks, as opposed to i.i.d. data from an invariant model widely considered in current literature of structural estimation. In particular, we consider the scenario in which the model evolves in a piece-wise constant fashion. We propose a procedure that minimizes the so-called TESLA loss (i.e., temporally smoothed L1 regularized regression), which allows jointly estimating the partition boundaries of the VCVS model and the coefficient of the sparse precision matrix on each block of the partition. A highly scalable proximal gradient method is proposed to solve the resultant convex optimization problem; and the conditions for sparsistent estimation and the convergence rate of both the partition boundaries and the network structure are established for the first time for such estimators.",
    "We propose a novel application of the Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (S-OMP) procedure for sparsistant variable selection in ultra-high dimensional multi-task regression problems. Screening of variables, as introduced in \\cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to remove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining all the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a manageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to identify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs to perform fast screening of relevant variables. As our main theoretical contribution, we prove that, asymptotically, S-OMP is guaranteed to reduce an ultra-high number of variables to below the sample size without losing true relevant variables. We also provide formal evidence that a modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently determine the number of iterations in S-OMP. We further provide empirical evidence on the benefit of variable selection using multiple regression outputs jointly, as opposed to performing variable selection for each output separately. The finite sample performance of S-OMP is demonstrated on extensive simulation studies, and on a genetic association mapping problem. $Keywords$ Adaptive Lasso; Greedy forward regression; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Multi-output regression; Multi-task learning; Simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit; Sure screening; Variable selection",
    "With the present revival of interest in bistatic radar systems, research in that area has gained momentum. Given some of the strategic advantages for a bistatic configuration, and tech- nological advances in the past few years, large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least par- tially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facil- ity in a bistatic radar system is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that, contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the ATR per- formance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results, suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR per- formance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR algorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented.",
    "In the applications related to airborne radars, simulation has always played an important role. This is mainly because of the two fold reason of the unavailability of desired data and the difficulty associated with the collection of data under controlled environment. A simple example will be regarding the collection of pure multipolar radar data. Even after phenomenal development in the field of radar hardware design and signal processing, till now the collection of pure multipolar data is a challenge for the radar system designers. Till very recently, the power of computer simulation of radar signal return was available to a very selected few. This was because of the heavy cost associated with some of the main line electro magnetic (EM) simulators for radar signal simulation, and secondly because many such EM simulators are for restricted marketting. However, because of the fast progress made in the field of EM simulation, many of the current generic EM simulators can be used to simulate radar returns from realistic targets. The current article expounds the steps towards generating a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image database of ground targets, using a eneric EM g simulator. It also demonstrates by the help of some example images, the quality of the SAR mage generated i using a general purpose EM simulator.",
    "We propose in this work a new family of kernels for variable-length time series. Our work builds upon the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we consider the likelihood function p_{\\theta}(x) of different parameters \\theta in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and x', we form the product of their features p_{\\theta}(x) p_{\\theta}(x') which is integrated out w.r.t \\theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel \\kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram matrices produced by \\kappa on observations and subsequences of observations enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques. These kernels are compared to other known kernels using a set of benchmark classification tasks carried out with support vector machines.",
    "Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks, linear acyclic models are typically used to model the data-generating process of variables. Recently, it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies the full structure of a linear acyclic model, i.e., a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths, without using any prior knowledge on the network structure, which is not the case with conventional methods. However, existing estimation methods are based on iterative search algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a finite number of steps. In this paper, we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal ordering and connection strengths based on non-Gaussianity.   In contrast to the previous methods, our algorithm requires no algorithmic parameters and is guaranteed to converge to the right solution within a small fixed number of steps if the data strictly follows the model.",
    "Existing approaches to analyzing the asymptotics of graph Laplacians typically assume a well-behaved kernel function with smoothness assumptions. We remove the smoothness assumption and generalize the analysis of graph Laplacians to include previously unstudied graphs including kNN graphs. We also introduce a kernel-free framework to analyze graph constructions with shrinking neighborhoods in general and apply it to analyze locally linear embedding (LLE). We also describe how for a given limiting Laplacian operator desirable properties such as a convergent spectrum and sparseness can be achieved choosing the appropriate graph construction.",
    "A collaborative convex framework for factoring a data matrix $X$ into a non-negative product $AS$, with a sparse coefficient matrix $S$, is proposed. We restrict the columns of the dictionary matrix $A$ to coincide with certain columns of the data matrix $X$, thereby guaranteeing a physically meaningful dictionary and dimensionality reduction. We use $l_{1,\\infty}$ regularization to select the dictionary from the data and show this leads to an exact convex relaxation of $l_0$ in the case of distinct noise free data. We also show how to relax the restriction-to-$X$ constraint by initializing an alternating minimization approach with the solution of the convex model, obtaining a dictionary close to but not necessarily in $X$. We focus on applications of the proposed framework to hyperspectral endmember and abundances identification and also show an application to blind source separation of NMR data.",
    "This paper treats the problem of screening for variables with high correlations in high dimensional data in which there can be many fewer samples than variables. We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for three related applications: screening for variables with large correlations within a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables with large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation screening); screening for variables that have persistently large auto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The novelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of variables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a number of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase transition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of discoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean number of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the number of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution. We also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries is dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for the false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous dividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can be obtained. It also overcomes some of the major hurdles faced by existing methods in the literature as correlation screening is naturally scalable to high dimension. Numerical results strongly validate the theory that is presented in this paper. We illustrate the application of the correlation screening methodology on a large scale gene-expression dataset, revealing a few influential variables that exhibit a significant amount of correlation over multiple treatments.",
    "Unsupervised discovery of latent representations, in addition to being useful for density modeling, visualisation and exploratory data analysis, is also increasingly important for learning features relevant to discriminative tasks. Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge, however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for particular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing such problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the incorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to the label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies instead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that there exists a function that can predict the label information, without explicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance mechanism is confirmed on two datasets. In particular, this approach is able to incorporate invariance information (lighting, elevation, etc.) from the small NORB object recognition dataset and yields state-of-the-art performance for a single layer, non-convolutional network.",
    "We propose an active set selection framework for Gaussian process classification for cases when the dataset is large enough to render its inference prohibitive. Our scheme consists of a two step alternating procedure of active set update rules and hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal likelihood maximization. The active set update rules rely on the ability of the predictive distributions of a Gaussian process classifier to estimate the relative contribution of a datapoint when being either included or removed from the model. This means that we can use it to include points with potentially high impact to the classifier decision process while removing those that are less relevant. We introduce two active set rules based on different criteria, the first one prefers a model with interpretable active set parameters whereas the second puts computational complexity first, thus a model with active set parameters that directly control its complexity. We also provide both theoretical and empirical support for our active set selection strategy being a good approximation of a full Gaussian process classifier. Our extensive experiments show that our approach can compete with state-of-the-art classification techniques with reasonable time complexity.

    "We investigate the learning rate of multiple kernel leaning (MKL) with elastic-net regularization, which consists of an $\\ell_1$-regularizer for inducing the sparsity and an $\\ell_2$-regularizer for controlling the smoothness. We focus on a sparse setting where the total number of kernels is large but the number of non-zero components of the ground truth is relatively small, and prove that elastic-net MKL achieves the minimax learning rate on the $\\ell_2$-mixed-norm ball. Our bound is sharper than the convergence rates ever shown, and has a property that the smoother the truth is, the faster the convergence rate is.",
    "We derive an upper bound on the local Rademacher complexity of $\\ell_p$-norm multiple kernel learning, which yields a tighter excess risk bound than global approaches. Previous local approaches aimed at analyzed the case $p=1$ only while our analysis covers all cases $1\\leq p\\leq\\infty$, assuming the different feature mappings corresponding to the different kernels to be uncorrelated. We also show a lower bound that shows that the bound is tight, and derive consequences regarding excess loss, namely fast convergence rates of the order $O(n^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}})$, where $\\alpha$ is the minimum eigenvalue decay rate of the individual kernels.",
    "We present a probabilistic viewpoint to multiple kernel learning unifying well-known regularised risk approaches and recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference relaxations. The framework proposes a general objective function suitable for regression, robust regression and classification that is lower bound of the marginal likelihood and contains many regularised risk approaches as special cases. Furthermore, we derive an efficient and provably convergent optimisation algorithm.",
    "Gaussian Process (GP) models are often used as mathematical approximations of computationally expensive experiments. Provided that its kernel is suitably chosen and that enough data is available to obtain a reasonable fit of the simulator, a GP model can beneficially be used for tasks such as prediction, optimization, or Monte-Carlo-based quantification of uncertainty. However, the former conditions become unrealistic when using classical GPs as the dimension of input increases. One popular alternative is then to turn to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), relying on the assumption that the simulator's response can approximately be decomposed as a sum of univariate functions. If such an approach has been successfully applied in approximation, it is nevertheless not completely compatible with the GP framework and its versatile applications. The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into the use of GPs for additive models by integrating additivity within the kernel, and proposing a parsimonious numerical method for data-driven parameter estimation. The first part of this article deals with the kernels naturally associated to additive processes and the properties of the GP models based on such kernels. The second part is dedicated to a numerical procedure based on relaxation for additive kernel parameter estimation. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated and compared to other approaches on Sobol's g-function.",
    "We present two sets of theoretical results on the grouped lasso with overlap of Jacob, Obozinski and Vert (2009) in the linear regression setting. This method allows for joint selection of predictors in sparse regression, allowing for complex structured sparsity over the predictors encoded as a set of groups. This flexible framework suggests that arbitrarily complex structures can be encoded with an intricate set of groups. Our results show that this strategy results in unexpected theoretical consequences for the procedure. In particular, we give two sets of results: (1) finite sample bounds on prediction and estimation, and (2) asymptotic distribution and selection. Both sets of results give insight into the consequences of choosing an increasingly complex set of groups for the procedure, as well as what happens when the set of groups cannot recover the true sparsity pattern. Additionally, these results demonstrate the differences and similarities between the the grouped lasso procedure with and without overlapping groups. Our analysis shows the set of groups must be chosen with caution - an overly complex set of groups will damage the analysis.",
    "We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN), a Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models correlation structure between the weights of the atoms at the group level. We derive a representation of DILN as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed random variables, and study its statistical properties. We consider applications to topic modeling and derive a variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference. We study the empirical performance of the DILN topic model on four corpora, comparing performance with the HDP and the correlated topic model (CTM). To deal with large-scale data sets, we also develop an online inference algorithm for DILN and compare with online HDP and online LDA on the Nature magazine, which contains approximately 350,000 articles.",
    "The purpose of sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is to find the low-dimensional subspace of input features that is sufficient for predicting output values. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-free SDR method called sufficient component analysis (SCA), which is computationally more efficient than existing methods. In our method, a solution is computed by iteratively performing dependence estimation and maximization: Dependence estimation is analytically carried out by recently-proposed least-squares mutual information (LSMI), and dependence maximization is also analytically carried out by utilizing the Epanechnikov kernel. Through large-scale experiments on real-world image classification and audio tagging problems, the proposed method is shown to compare favorably with existing dimension reduction approaches.",
    "We theoretically investigate the convergence rate and support consistency (i.e., correctly identifying the subset of non-zero coefficients in the large sample limit) of multiple kernel learning (MKL). We focus on MKL with block-l1 regularization (inducing sparse kernel combination), block-l2 regularization (inducing uniform kernel combination), and elastic-net regularization (including both block-l1 and block-l2 regularization). For the case where the true kernel combination is sparse, we show a sharper convergence rate of the block-l1 and elastic-net MKL methods than the existing rate for block-l1 MKL. We further show that elastic-net MKL requires a milder condition for being consistent than block-l1 MKL. For the case where the optimal kernel combination is not exactly sparse, we prove that elastic-net MKL can achieve a faster convergence rate than the block-l1 and block-l2 MKL methods by carefully controlling the balance between the block-l1and block-l2 regularizers. Thus, our theoretical results overall suggest the use of elastic-net regularization in MKL.",
    "In this paper, we give a new sharp generalization bound of lp-MKL which is a generalized framework of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and imposes lp-mixed-norm regularization instead of l1-mixed-norm regularization. We utilize localization techniques to obtain the sharp learning rate. The bound is characterized by the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the associated kernels. A larger decay rate gives a faster convergence rate. Furthermore, we give the minimax learning rate on the ball characterized by lp-mixed-norm in the product space. Then we show that our derived learning rate of lp-MKL achieves the minimax optimal rate on the lp-mixed-norm ball.",
    "The discovery of non-linear causal relationship under additive non-Gaussian noise models has attracted considerable attention recently because of their high flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference algorithm called least-squares independence regression (LSIR). LSIR learns the additive noise model through the minimization of an estimator of the squared-loss mutual information between inputs and residuals. A notable advantage of LSIR over existing approaches is that tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation, allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion. Through experiments with real-world datasets, we show that LSIR compares favorably with a state-of-the-art causal inference method.",
    "In this paper, auto-associative models are proposed as candidates to the generalization of Principal Component Analysis. We show that these models are dedicated to the approximation of the dataset by a manifold. Here, the word \"manifold\" refers to the topology properties of the structure. The approximating manifold is built by a projection pursuit algorithm. At each step of the algorithm, the dimension of the manifold is incremented. Some theoretical properties are provided. In particular, we can show that, at each step of the algorithm, the mean residuals norm is not increased. Moreover, it is also established that the algorithm converges in a finite number of steps. Some particular auto-associative models are exhibited and compared to the classical PCA and some neural networks models. Implementation aspects are discussed. We show that, in numerous cases, no optimization procedure is required. Some illustrations on simulated and real data are presented.",
    "Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers - that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an L0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved estimator obtained after replacing the L0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators.",
    "Many real-world problems encountered in several disciplines deal with the modeling of time-series containing different underlying dynamical regimes, for which probabilistic approaches are very often employed. In this paper we describe several such approaches in the common framework of graphical models. We give a unified overview of models previously introduced in the literature, which is simpler and more comprehensive than previous descriptions and enables us to highlight commonalities and differences among models that were not observed in the past. In addition, we present several new models and inference routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint.",
    "A linear non-Gaussian structural equation model called LiNGAM is an identifiable model for exploratory causal analysis. Previous methods estimate a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths based on a single dataset. However, in many application domains, data are obtained under different conditions, that is, multiple datasets are obtained rather than a single dataset. In this paper, we present a new method to jointly estimate multiple LiNGAMs under the assumption that the models share a causal ordering but may have different connection strengths and differently distributed variables. In simulations, the new method estimates the models more accurately than estimating them separately.",
    "Inverse inference, or \"brain reading\", is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, based on pattern recognition and statistical learning. By predicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps, this approach aims at decoding brain activity. Inverse inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since there are far more features than samples, i.e., more voxels than fMRI volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been proposed, such as, among others, univariate feature selection, feature agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a sparse hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial structure of the data at different scales into the regularization, which makes the overall prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. The regularization used induces the selection of spatially coherent predictive brain regions simultaneously at different scales. We test our algorithm on real data acquired to study the mental representation of objects, and we show that the proposed algorithm not only delineates meaningful brain regions but yields as well better prediction accuracy than reference methods.",
    "We compare the risk of ridge regression to a simple variant of ordinary least squares, in which one simply projects the data onto a finite dimensional subspace (as specified by a Principal Component Analysis) and then performs an ordinary (un-regularized) least squares regression in this subspace. This note shows that the risk of this ordinary least squares method is within a constant factor (namely 4) of the risk of ridge regression.",
    "We define and discuss the first sparse coding algorithm based on closed-form EM updates and continuous latent variables. The underlying generative model consists of a standard `spike-and-slab' prior and a Gaussian noise model. Closed-form solutions for E- and M-step equations are derived by generalizing probabilistic PCA. The resulting EM algorithm can take all modes of a potentially multi-modal posterior into account. The computational cost of the algorithm scales exponentially with the number of hidden dimensions. However, with current computational resources, it is still possible to efficiently learn model parameters for medium-scale problems. Thus the model can be applied to the typical range of source separation tasks. In numerical experiments on artificial data we verify likelihood maximization and show that the derived algorithm recovers the sparse directions of standard sparse coding distributions. On source separation benchmarks comprised of realistic data we show that the algorithm is competitive with other recent methods.",
    "In data sets with many more features than observations, independent screening based on all univariate regression models leads to a computationally convenient variable selection method. Recent efforts have shown that in the case of generalized linear models, independent screening may suffice to capture all relevant features with high probability, even in ultra-high dimension. It is unclear whether this formal sure screening property is attainable when the response is a right-censored survival time. We propose a computationally very efficient independent screening method for survival data which can be viewed as the natural survival equivalent of correlation screening. We state conditions under which the method admits the sure screening property within a general class of single-index hazard rate models with ultra-high dimensional features. An iterative variant is also described which combines screening with penalized regression in order to handle more complex feature covariance structures. The methods are evaluated through simulation studies and through application to a real gene expression dataset.",
    "We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of the forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible set of actions. We study the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial information models of the so-called \"semi-bandit\", and \"bandit\" problems. We consider both $L_\\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary.   We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007), Dani et al. (2008), Abernethy et al. (2008), Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009), Helmbold and Warmuth (2009), Koolen et al. (2010), Uchiya et al. (2010), Kale et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck (2010). We provide simple proofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a constant factor. Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et al. (2010) by showing that the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\\infty}$ adversaries.",
    "In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a criterion for PAC learnability of a concept class $\\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the domain $\\Omega$. The uniform Glivenko--Cantelli property with respect to non-atomic measures is no longer a necessary condition, and consistent learnability cannot in general be expected. Our criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter $\\VC({\\mathscr C}\\,{\\mathrm{mod}}\\,\\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by \"thickening up\" single points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable \"clusters\". Equivalently, $\\VC(\\mathscr C\\modd\\omega_1)\\leq d$ if and only if every countable subclass of $\\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\\leq d$ outside a countable subset of $\\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed as the classical VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset of a compactification of $\\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions on $\\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA). Similar results are obtained for function learning in terms of fat-shattering dimension modulo countable sets, but, just like in the classical distribution-free case, the finiteness of this parameter is sufficient but not necessary for PAC learnability under non-atomic measures.",
    "We propose a restricted collapsed draw (RCD) sampler, a general Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler of simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Chinese restaurant process (HCRP) with restriction. Models that require simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Dirichlet process with restriction, such as infinite Hidden markov models (iHMM), were difficult to enjoy benefits of \\markerg{the} HCRP due to combinatorial explosion in calculating distributions of coupled draws. By constructing a proposal of seating arrangements (partitioning) and stochastically accepts the proposal by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the RCD sampler makes accurate sampling for complex combination of draws while retaining efficiency of HCRP representation. Based on the RCD sampler, we developed a series of sophisticated sampling algorithms for iHMMs, including blocked Gibbs sampling, beam sampling, and split-merge sampling, that outperformed conventional iHMM samplers in experiments",
    "A number of recent work studied the effectiveness of feature selection using Lasso. It is known that under the restricted isometry properties (RIP), Lasso does not generally lead to the exact recovery of the set of nonzero coefficients, due to the looseness of convex relaxation. This paper considers the feature selection property of nonconvex regularization, where the solution is given by a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure recovers the set of nonzero coefficients without suffering from the bias of Lasso relaxation, which complements parameter estimation results of this procedure.",
    "This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate auto-regressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a \"false connection score.\" In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that the false connection score is less than one. The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in non-asymptotic regimes. The conditions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",
    "Due to space limitations, our submission \"Source Separation and Clustering of Phase-Locked Subspaces\", accepted for publication on the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks in 2011, presented some results without proof. Those proofs are provided in this paper.",
    "We introduce the Pitman Yor Diffusion Tree (PYDT) for hierarchical clustering, a generalization of the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree (Neal, 2001) which removes the restriction to binary branching structure. The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary.",
    "Given a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H of real-valued functions and a suitable measure mu over the source space D (subset of R), we decompose H as the sum of a subspace of centered functions for mu and its orthogonal in H. This decomposition leads to a special case of ANOVA kernels, for which the functional ANOVA representation of the best predictor can be elegantly derived, either in an interpolation or regularization framework. The proposed kernels appear to be particularly convenient for analyzing the e ffect of each (group of) variable(s) and computing sensitivity indices without recursivity.",
    "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is now a common tool for audio source separation. When learning NMF on large audio databases, one major drawback is that the complexity in time is O(FKN) when updating the dictionary (where (F;N) is the dimension of the input power spectrograms, and K the number of basis spectra), thus forbidding its application on signals longer than an hour. We provide an online algorithm with a complexity of O(FK) in time and memory for updates in the dictionary. We show on audio simulations that the online approach is faster for short audio signals and allows to analyze audio signals of several hours.",
    "We study the problem of estimating from data, a sparse approximation to the inverse covariance matrix. Estimating a sparsity constrained inverse covariance matrix is a key component in Gaussian graphical model learning, but one that is numerically very challenging. We address this challenge by developing a new adaptive gradient-based method that carefully combines gradient information with an adaptive step-scaling strategy, which results in a scalable, highly competitive method. Our algorithm, like its predecessors, maximizes an $\\ell_1$-norm penalized log-likelihood and has the same per iteration arithmetic complexity as the best methods in its class. Our experiments reveal that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, often significantly so, for large problems.",
    "We describe a simple and efficient procedure for approximating the L\\'evy measure of a $\\text{Gamma}(\\alpha,1)$ random variable. We use this approximation to derive a finite sum-representation that converges almost surely to Ferguson's representation of the Dirichlet process based on arrivals of a homogeneous Poisson process. We compare the efficiency of our approximation to several other well known approximations of the Dirichlet process and demonstrate a substantial improvement.",
    "In many areas of machine learning, it becomes necessary to find the eigenvector decompositions of large matrices. We discuss two methods for reducing the computational burden of spectral decompositions: the more venerable Nystom extension and a newly introduced algorithm based on random projections. Previous work has centered on the ability to reconstruct the original matrix. We argue that a more interesting and relevant comparison is their relative performance in clustering and classification tasks using the approximate eigenvectors as features. We demonstrate that performance is task specific and depends on the rank of the approximation.",
    "This paper studies the deviations of the regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. When the total number of plays n is known beforehand by the agent, Audibert et al. (2009) exhibit a policy such that with probability at least 1-1/n, the regret of the policy is of order log(n). They have also shown that such a property is not shared by the popular ucb1 policy of Auer et al. (2002). This work first answers an open question: it extends this negative result to any anytime policy. The second contribution of this paper is to design anytime robust policies for specific multi-armed bandit problems in which some restrictions are put on the set of possible distributions of the different arms.",
    "The performance of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefficient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm [\\textit{IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory} \\textbf{55} (2009) 2183--2202]. Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefficient vector, whereby one has only control on the $\\ell_1$ norm of the smaller coefficients, is also analyzed. As a consequence of these results, we also show that the coefficient estimate satisfies strong oracle type inequalities.",
    "We consider the problem of learning a forest of nonlinear decision rules with general loss functions. The standard methods employ boosted decision trees such as Adaboost for exponential loss and Friedman's gradient boosting for general loss. In contrast to these traditional boosting algorithms that treat a tree learner as a black box, the method we propose directly learns decision forests via fully-corrective regularized greedy search using the underlying forest structure. Our method achieves higher accuracy and smaller models than gradient boosting (and Adaboost with exponential loss) on many datasets.",
    "When response variables are nominal and populations are cross-classified with respect to multiple polytomies, questions often arise about the degree of association of the responses with explanatory variables. When populations are known, we introduce a nominal association vector and matrix to evaluate the dependence of a response variable with an explanatory variable. These measures provide detailed evaluations of nominal associations at both local and global levels. We also define a general class of global association measures which embraces the well known association measure by Goodman-Kruskal (1954). The proposed association matrix also gives rise to the expected generalized confusion matrix in classification. The hierarchy of equivalence relations defined by the association vector and matrix are also shown.",
    "We present a probabilistic model for natural images which is based on Gaussian scale mixtures and a simple multiscale representation. In contrast to the dominant approach to modeling whole images focusing on Markov random fields, we formulate our model in terms of a directed graphical model. We show that it is able to generate images with interesting higher-order correlations when trained on natural images or samples from an occlusion based model. More importantly, the directed model enables us to perform a principled evaluation. While it is easy to generate visually appealing images, we demonstrate that our model also yields the best performance reported to date when evaluated with respect to the cross-entropy rate, a measure tightly linked to the average log-likelihood.",
    "Modelling the real world complexity of music is a challenge for machine learning. We address the task of modeling melodic sequences from the same music genre. We perform a comparative analysis of two probabilistic models; a Dirichlet Variable Length Markov Model (Dirichlet-VMM) and a Time Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TC-RBM). We show that the TC-RBM learns descriptive music features, such as underlying chords and typical melody transitions and dynamics. We assess the models for future prediction and compare their performance to a VMM, which is the current state of the art in melody generation. We show that both models perform significantly better than the VMM, with the Dirichlet-VMM marginally outperforming the TC-RBM. Finally, we evaluate the short order statistics of the models, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between test sequences and model samples, and show that our proposed methods match the statistics of the music genre significantly better than the VMM.",
    "We introduce a factor analysis model that summarizes the dependencies between observed variable groups, instead of dependencies between individual variables as standard factor analysis does. A group may correspond to one view of the same set of objects, one of many data sets tied by co-occurrence, or a set of alternative variables collected from statistics tables to measure one property of interest. We show that by assuming group-wise sparse factors, active in a subset of the sets, the variation can be decomposed into factors explaining relationships between the sets and factors explaining away set-specific variation. We formulate the assumptions in a Bayesian model which provides the factors, and apply the model to two data analysis tasks, in neuroimaging and chemical systems biology.",
    "Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius.   Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure.",
    "There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that exact nearest neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces is affected by the curse of dimensionality at a fundamental level. Does it necessarily mean that the same is true for k nearest neighbours based learning algorithms such as the k-NN classifier? We analyse this question at a number of levels and show that the answer is different at each of them. As our first main observation, we show the consistency of a k approximate nearest neighbour classifier. However, the performance of the classifier in very high dimensions is provably unstable. As our second main observation, we point out that the existing model for statistical learning is oblivious of dimension of the domain and so every learning problem admits a universally consistent deterministic reduction to the one-dimensional case by means of a Borel isomorphism.",
    "We propose a method called ideal regression for approximating an arbitrary system of polynomial equations by a system of a particular type. Using techniques from approximate computational algebraic geometry, we show how we can solve ideal regression directly without resorting to numerical optimization. Ideal regression is useful whenever the solution to a learning problem can be described by a system of polynomial equations. As an example, we demonstrate how to formulate Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA), a source separation problem, in terms of ideal regression, which also yields a consistent estimator for SSA. We then compare this estimator in simulations with previous optimization-based approaches for SSA.",
    "We consider a Gaussian process formulation of the multiple kernel learning problem. The goal is to select the convex combination of kernel matrices that best explains the data and by doing so improve the generalisation on unseen data. Sparsity in the kernel weights is obtained by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach: Gaussian process priors are imposed over the latent functions and generalised inverse Gaussians on their associated weights. This construction is equivalent to imposing a product of heavy-tailed process priors over function space. A variational inference algorithm is derived for regression and binary classification.",
    "We propose a scalable, efficient and statistically motivated computational framework for Graphical Lasso (Friedman et al., 2007b) - a covariance regularization framework that has received significant attention in the statistics community over the past few years. Existing algorithms have trouble in scaling to dimensions larger than a thousand. Our proposal significantly enhances the state-of-the-art for such moderate sized problems and gracefully scales to larger problems where other algorithms become practically infeasible. This requires a few key new ideas. We operate on the primal problem and use a subtle variation of block-coordinate-methods which drastically reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the convergence and complexity of our algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal via experiments. We believe that our framework extends the applicability of Graphical Lasso to large-scale modern applications like bioinformatics, collaborative filtering and social networks, among others.",
    "We propose a novel method of introducing structure into existing machine learning techniques by developing structure-based similarity and distance measures. To learn structural information, low-dimensional structure of the data is captured by solving a non-linear, low-rank representation problem. We show that this low-rank representation can be kernelized, has a closed-form solution, allows for separation of independent manifolds, and is robust to noise. From this representation, similarity between observations based on non-linear structure is computed and can be incorporated into existing feature transformations, dimensionality reduction techniques, and machine learning methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show performance improvements for clustering, and anomaly detection through the use of structural similarity.",
    "Most methods for decision-theoretic online learning are based on the Hedge algorithm, which takes a parameter called the learning rate. In most previous analyses the learning rate was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance, leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances, for example when there exists an action that is significantly better than all others. We propose a new way of setting the learning rate, which adapts to the difficulty of the learning problem: in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance, but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret. In particular, our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a probabilistic setting, when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions. We also provide a simulation study comparing our approach to existing methods.",
    "Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it only involves continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially easier to solve than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve non-convex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.",
    "The asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation of Benaim, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields. Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through learning in a Markov decision process.",
    "Exact inference in the linear regression model with spike and slab priors is often intractable. Expectation propagation (EP) can be used for approximate inference. However, the regular sequential form of EP (R-EP) may fail to converge in this model when the size of the training set is very small. As an alternative, we propose a provably convergent EP algorithm (PC-EP). PC-EP is proved to minimize an energy function which, under some constraints, is bounded from below and whose stationary points coincide with the solution of R-EP. Experiments with synthetic data indicate that when R-EP does not converge, the approximation generated by PC-EP is often better. By contrast, when R-EP converges, both methods perform similarly.",
    "Unbalanced data arises in many learning tasks such as clustering of multi-class data, hierarchical divisive clustering and semisupervised learning. Graph-based approaches are popular tools for these problems. Graph construction is an important aspect of graph-based learning. We show that graph-based algorithms can fail for unbalanced data for many popular graphs such as k-NN, \\epsilon-neighborhood and full-RBF graphs. We propose a novel graph construction technique that encodes global statistical information into node degrees through a ranking scheme. The rank of a data sample is an estimate of its p-value and is proportional to the total number of data samples with smaller density. This ranking scheme serves as a surrogate for density; can be reliably estimated; and indicates whether a data sample is close to valleys/modes. This rank-modulated degree(RMD) scheme is able to significantly sparsify the graph near valleys and provides an adaptive way to cope with unbalanced data. We then theoretically justify our method through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.",
    "In this article, we have proposed several approaches for post processing a large ensemble of prediction models or rules. The results from our simulations show that the post processing methods we have considered here are promising. We have used the techniques developed here for estimation of quantitative traits from markers, on the benchmark \"Bostob Housing\"data set and in some simulations. In most cases, the produced models had better prediction performance than, for example, the ones produced by the random forest or the rulefit algorithms.",
    "This paper is devoted to regret lower bounds in the classical model of stochastic multi-armed bandit. A well-known result of Lai and Robbins, which has then been extended by Burnetas and Katehakis, has established the presence of a logarithmic bound for all consistent policies. We relax the notion of consistence, and exhibit a generalisation of the logarithmic bound. We also show the non existence of logarithmic bound in the general case of Hannan consistency. To get these results, we study variants of popular Upper Confidence Bounds (ucb) policies. As a by-product, we prove that it is impossible to design an adaptive policy that would select the best of two algorithms by taking advantage of the properties of the environment.",
    "This paper develops a general theoretical framework to analyze structured sparse recovery problems using the notation of dual certificate. Although certain aspects of the dual certificate idea have already been used in some previous work, due to the lack of a general and coherent theory, the analysis has so far only been carried out in limited scopes for specific problems. In this context the current paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a general definition of dual certificate, which we then use to develop a unified theory of sparse recovery analysis for convex programming. Second, we present a class of structured sparsity regularization called structured Lasso for which calculations can be readily performed under our theoretical framework. This new theory includes many seemingly loosely related previous work as special cases; it also implies new results that improve existing ones even for standard formulations such as L1 regularization.",
    "In many situations where the interest lies in identifying clusters one might expect that not all available variables carry information about these groups. Furthermore, data quality (e.g. outliers or missing entries) might present a serious and sometimes hard-to-assess problem for large and complex datasets. In this paper we show that a small proportion of atypical observations might have serious adverse effects on the solutions found by the sparse clustering algorithm of Witten and Tibshirani (2010). We propose a robustification of their sparse K-means algorithm based on the trimmed K-means algorithm of Cuesta-Albertos et al. (1997) Our proposal is also able to handle datasets with missing values. We illustrate the use of our method on microarray data for cancer patients where we are able to identify strong biological clusters with a much reduced number of genes. Our simulation studies show that, when there are outliers in the data, our robust sparse K-means algorithm performs better than other competing methods both in terms of the selection of features and also the identified clusters. This robust sparse K-means algorithm is implemented in the R package RSKC which is publicly available from the CRAN repository.",
    "Many modern data mining applications are concerned with the analysis of datasets in which the observations are described by paired high-dimensional vectorial representations or \"views\". Some typical examples can be found in web mining and genomics applications. In this article we present an algorithm for data clustering with multiple views, Multi-View Predictive Partitioning (MVPP), which relies on a novel criterion of predictive similarity between data points. We assume that, within each cluster, the dependence between multivariate views can be modelled by using a two-block partial least squares (TB-PLS) regression model, which performs dimensionality reduction and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional settings. The proposed MVPP algorithm partitions the data such that the within-cluster predictive ability between views is maximised. The proposed objective function depends on a measure of predictive influence of points under the TB-PLS model which has been derived as an extension of the PRESS statistic commonly used in ordinary least squares regression. Using simulated data, we compare the performance of MVPP to that of competing multi-view clustering methods which rely upon geometric structures of points, but ignore the predictive relationship between the two views. State-of-art results are obtained on benchmark web mining datasets.",
    "We propose a new yet natural algorithm for learning the graph structure of general discrete graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields) from samples. Our algorithm finds the neighborhood of a node by sequentially adding nodes that produce the largest reduction in empirical conditional entropy; it is greedy in the sense that the choice of addition is based only on the reduction achieved at that iteration. Its sequential nature gives it a lower computational complexity as compared to other existing comparison-based techniques, all of which involve exhaustive searches over every node set of a certain size. Our main result characterizes the sample complexity of this procedure, as a function of node degrees, graph size and girth in factor-graph representation. We subsequently specialize this result to the case of Ising models, where we provide a simple transparent characterization of sample complexity as a function of model and graph parameters.   For tree graphs, our algorithm is the same as the classical Chow-Liu algorithm, and in that sense can be considered the extension of the same to graphs with cycles.",
    "In this paper, we propose a semiparametric approach, named nonparanormal skeptic, for efficiently and robustly estimating high dimensional undirected graphical models. To achieve modeling flexibility, we consider Gaussian Copula graphical models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). To achieve estimation robustness, we exploit nonparametric rank-based correlation coefficient estimators, including Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. In high dimensional settings, we prove that the nonparanormal skeptic achieves the optimal parametric rate of convergence in both graph and parameter estimation. This celebrating result suggests that the Gaussian copula graphical models can be used as a safe replacement of the popular Gaussian graphical models, even when the data are truly Gaussian. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conduct thorough numerical simulations to compare different estimators for their graph recovery performance under both ideal and noisy settings. The proposed methods are then applied on a large-scale genomic dataset to illustrate their empirical usefulness. The R language software package huge implementing the proposed methods is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran. r-project.org/.",
    "High-dimensional tensors or multi-way data are becoming prevalent in areas such as biomedical imaging, chemometrics, networking and bibliometrics. Traditional approaches to finding lower dimensional representations of tensor data include flattening the data and applying matrix factorizations such as principal components analysis (PCA) or employing tensor decompositions such as the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions. The former can lose important structure in the data, while the latter Higher-Order PCA (HOPCA) methods can be problematic in high-dimensions with many irrelevant features. We introduce frameworks for sparse tensor factorizations or Sparse HOPCA based on heuristic algorithmic approaches and by solving penalized optimization problems related to the CP decomposition. Extensions of these approaches lead to methods for general regularized tensor factorizations, multi-way Functional HOPCA and generalizations of HOPCA for structured data. We illustrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, and signal recovery on simulated data and multi-dimensional microarrays and functional MRIs.",
    "Existing methods for sparse channel estimation typically provide an estimate computed as the solution maximizing an objective function defined as the sum of the log-likelihood function and a penalization term proportional to the l1-norm of the parameter of interest. However, other penalization terms have proven to have strong sparsity-inducing properties. In this work, we design pilot-assisted channel estimators for OFDM wireless receivers within the framework of sparse Bayesian learning by defining hierarchical Bayesian prior models that lead to sparsity-inducing penalization terms. The estimators result as an application of the variational message-passing algorithm on the factor graph representing the signal model extended with the hierarchical prior models. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our channel estimators as compared to traditional and state-of-the-art sparse methods.",
    "We consider to learn a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data.",
    "Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classification as C-learning, and we present efficient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized ${\\cal C}$-learning models.",
    "We consider the problem of learning a set from random samples. We show how relevant geometric and topological properties of a set can be studied analytically using concepts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A new kind of reproducing kernel, that we call separating kernel, plays a crucial role in our study and is analyzed in detail. We prove a new analytic characterization of the support of a distribution, that naturally leads to a family of provably consistent regularized learning algorithms and we discuss the stability of these methods with respect to random sampling. Numerical experiments show that the approach is competitive, and often better, than other state of the art techniques.",
    "High-dimensional data common in genomics, proteomics, and chemometrics often contains complicated correlation structures. Recently, partial least squares (PLS) and Sparse PLS methods have gained attention in these areas as dimension reduction techniques in the context of supervised data analysis. We introduce a framework for Regularized PLS by solving a relaxation of the SIMPLS optimization problem with penalties on the PLS loadings vectors. Our approach enjoys many advantages including flexibility, general penalties, easy interpretation of results, and fast computation in high-dimensional settings. We also outline extensions of our methods leading to novel methods for Non-negative PLS and Generalized PLS, an adaption of PLS for structured data. We demonstrate the utility of our methods through simulations and a case study on proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data.",
    "In this paper, we study statistical properties of semi-supervised learning, which is considered as an important problem in the community of machine learning. In the standard supervised learning, only the labeled data is observed. The classification and regression problems are formalized as the supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also obtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data is important to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This problems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data. Under the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered that the unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, it was revealed that the weighted estimator using the unlabeled data achieves better prediction accuracy in comparison to the learning method using only labeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model is misspecified. That is, the improvement under the semiparametric model with missing data is possible, when the semiparametric model is misspecified. In this paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight function in the semi-supervised learning. The benefit of our approach is that the proposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for the probability of the unlabeled data. Based on the statistical asymptotic theory, we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms the supervised learning using only labeled data. Some numerical experiments present the usefulness of our methods.",
    "In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we define such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. These properties lead us to EM algorithms for Bayesian sparse learning. We show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively re-weighted $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_1$ methods. In addition, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression.",
    "We present an new sequential Monte Carlo sampler for coalescent based Bayesian hierarchical clustering. Our model is appropriate for modeling non-i.i.d. data and offers a substantial reduction of computational cost when compared to the original sampler without resorting to approximations. We also propose a quadratic complexity approximation that in practice shows almost no loss in performance compared to its counterpart. We show that as a byproduct of our formulation, we obtain a greedy algorithm that exhibits performance improvement over other greedy algorithms, particularly in small data sets. In order to exploit the correlation structure of the data, we describe how to incorporate Gaussian process priors in the model as a flexible way to model non-i.i.d. data. Results on artificial and real data show significant improvements over closely related approaches.",
    "We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we call loosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short paths between any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independence test based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novel maximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detected correctly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samples required by our algorithm is C*log p, where p is the size of the graph and the constant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that several previously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov random fields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexity than the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get new results for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learns general Ising models on the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(p, c/p) correctly with running time O(np^5).",
    "We study the problem of prediction for evolving graph data. We formulate the problem as the minimization of a convex objective encouraging sparsity and low-rank of the solution, that reflect natural graph properties. The convex formulation allows to obtain oracle inequalities and efficient solvers. We provide empirical results for our algorithm and comparison with competing methods, and point out two open questions related to compressed sensing and algebra of low-rank and sparse matrices.",
    "Hierarchical parametric models consisting of observable and latent variables are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. For example, a mixture model is a representative hierarchical model for clustering. From the statistical point of view, the models can be regular or singular due to the distribution of data. In the regular case, the models have the identifiability; there is one-to-one relation between a probability density function for the model expression and the parameter. The Fisher information matrix is positive definite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variables has been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are not identifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventional statistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable. Recently, an algebraic geometrical analysis has been developed and is used to elucidate the Bayes estimation of observable variables. The present paper applies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines its theoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of the posterior distribution. It is found that the posterior of the observable-variable estimation can be different from the one in the latent-variable estimation. Because of the difference, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on the parameter and the latent variable cannot construct the desired posterior distribution.",
    "This paper considers the problem of robust subspace recovery: given a set of $N$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, if many lie in a $d$-dimensional subspace, then can we recover the underlying subspace? We show that Tyler's M-estimator can be used to recover the underlying subspace, if the percentage of the inliers is larger than $d/D$ and the data points lie in general position. Empirically, Tyler's M-estimator compares favorably with other convex subspace recovery algorithms in both simulations and experiments on real data sets.",
    "A mixture of Gaussians fit to a single curved or heavy-tailed cluster will report that the data contains many clusters. To produce more appropriate clusterings, we introduce a model which warps a latent mixture of Gaussians to produce nonparametric cluster shapes. The possibly low-dimensional latent mixture model allows us to summarize the properties of the high-dimensional clusters (or density manifolds) describing the data. The number of manifolds, as well as the shape and dimension of each manifold is automatically inferred. We derive a simple inference scheme for this model which analytically integrates out both the mixture parameters and the warping function. We show that our model is effective for density estimation, performs better than infinite Gaussian mixture models at recovering the true number of clusters, and produces interpretable summaries of high-dimensional datasets."
